Others, including NBC&rsquo;s website, were rather less sensationalist in their headlines: &lsquo;The face of God is in the eye of the beholder&rsquo;. The photograph in question showed a fuzzy blackand-white image of a middle-aged, beardless Caucasian male, with a soft, rounded face and just a hint of a smile (fig. 1). The image was produced by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who showed a demographically representative sample of US Christians a series of computer-generated faces embodying certain cultural stereotypes of emotional, ethical, social and spiritual values, and asked them to select those faces perceived to best reflect their mental image of God. Some of the faces were androgynous in appearance, while some were more feminine, and some more masculine. All the faces were grey, like a black-and-white photocopy, but some were lighter skinned and some were darker skinned. Some faces were expressive, some were seemingly blank. But each face was a canvas onto which the experiment&rsquo;s participants were free to project their own assumptions. The results were averaged out and used to create God&rsquo;s e-fit. Unsurprisingly, the study revealed that in the US, God is made in the image of a white American man. Psychologists and social anthropologists have long understood that a very heavy dose of cognitive bias underlies the construction of the divine in human societies. But while modern studies like those conducted at Chapel Hill can tell us something of the psychological and social processes underlying this tendency, this is hardly news. Over two and a half thousand years ago, in the late sixth or early fifth century BCE, the Greek intellectual and adventurer Xenophanes of Colophon had already arrived at a similar conclusion: &lsquo;If cattle and horses or lions had hands, or were able to draw with their hands and do the works that men can do, horses would draw the forms of the gods like horses, and cattle like cattle, and they would make their bodies such as they each had themselves&rsquo;. For Xenophanes, the human tendency to make gods in our own image was as much about local cultural preferences as overarching, lofty ideals, as the diversity of deities in his world attested: &lsquo;The Ethiopians say that their gods are broad-nosed and dark-skinned, the Thracians that theirs have blue eyes and red hair&rsquo;. As far as Xenophanes was concerned, the widespread assumption that the gods had bodies like those of their worshippers was inextricably linked to the notion that deities behaved very much like humans &ndash; and this was deeply problematic, for it inevitably cheapened the moral nature of the divine. Proof could be found in the Greek myths themselves: &lsquo;Homer and Hesiod have attributed to the gods everything that leads to blame and abuse among men &ndash; stealing, committing adultery, and deceiving each other&rsquo;, Xenophanes complained. It was an objection rooted in his philosophically driven insistence that a god was inherently and necessarily a being &lsquo;in no way like mortals either in body or thought&rsquo;. Fig. 1. The face of God, as imagined by a representative sample of US Christians in a recent study. The fuzzy quality of this computer-generated image reflects the composite process of the experiment. The study concluded that those surveyed envisaged God as similar to themselves in terms of physical appearance, age and race. Similar ideas were soon championed by other Greek thinkers, most notably Plato (c. 429&ndash;347 BCE), his student Aristotle (c. 384&ndash;322 BCE) and subsequent generations of their elitist, learned adherents in the GraecoRoman world, who theorized that the divine power ultimately undergirding the universe and everything in it was necessarily without a body &ndash; an incorporeal, invisible, abstract principle, force or intellect, wholly beyond and distinct from the material world. Not that these rarefied views made much of an impact on the religious lives of ordinary folk. Whether they were schooled in philosophy or not, and no matter the deities they worshipped, most people living in the Graeco-Roman world continued to envisage their gods as corporeal beings with bodies shaped like their own &ndash; much as they always had. But towards the close of the first millennium BCE, and into the early centuries of the Common Era, these erudite philosophical ideas would gradually come to shape the thinking of certain Jewish and Christian intellectuals, so that they began to re-imagine their deity in increasingly incorporeal, immaterial terms, drawing ever-sharper distinctions between the heavenly and the earthly, the divine and the human, and the spiritual and the bodily. It is the broadly Platonic notion of the otherness and unlikeness of the divine to anything in or beyond the universe that has shaped the more formal theological constructions of God in the Western religious imagination. And yet these constructions are built on a conceptual framework very much at odds with the Bible itself, for in these ancient texts, God is presented in startlingly anthropomorphic ways. This is a deity with a body. In the Beginning The high god had already spent several days speaking new marvels into being &ndash; separating the primeval waters of chaos into heavenly and underworld reservoirs; bringing forth dry land, planting it with fruit trees and crops; appointing the sun and moon to light day and night; and commanding the new-formed land, seas and skies to bring forth animals, fish and birds. Now, he was about to speak again. &lsquo;Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness&rsquo;, he says to the other deities in his retinue. It is more a declaration than a suggestion, but a good idea, nonetheless, for the humans will be tasked with keeping order in the newly created earthly realm. And so the high god makes the very first human: &lsquo;God created the human in his image, in the image of God he created him&rsquo;. The new creature &ndash; adam, meaning &lsquo;man&rsquo; or &lsquo;human&rsquo; &ndash; bears a bodily resemblance to his divine creator, and is swiftly paired with a female version: &lsquo;male and female he created them&rsquo;. Equipped with god-shaped bodies, humans are rendered superior to the other newly made creatures of the world, over whom they are appointed to rule. Blessing humans with fertility, the high god gives them two tasks: to procreate and dominate. They are to fill this new world with their offspring, and keep the other creatures under control. Satisfied with his creative accomplishments, the high god decides his work is done. The next day, he rests. In academic circles, there is nothing particularly contentious about this paraphrase of the opening chapter of the book of Genesis. Most biblical scholars would agree that when God says, &lsquo;Let us make humankind in our image, in our likeness&rsquo;, he is addressing the other members of the &lsquo;divine assembly&rsquo; &ndash; the biblical label given to God&rsquo;s council of lower-ranking deities and divine beings. And most would agree (even if some might squirm a little) that in being made in the image and likeness of the gods, freshly minted humans bear a visual resemblance to their own deities, just as Adam&rsquo;s son Seth is later said to be the &lsquo;image&rsquo; and &lsquo;likeness&rsquo; of his father, and in other biblical texts, divine statues are the &lsquo;image&rsquo; and &lsquo;likeness&rsquo; of the gods they represent. Written in about the fifth century BCE, but drawing on older mythologies, the creation story that now begins the Bible reflects a time when Yahweh &ndash; the deity of Jerusalem, now better known as God &ndash; had yet to be imagined as the only divine being in the universe. Like the Babylonian deity Marduk, or the Greek god Zeus, this ancient deity had long been cast as the king of the cosmos, but like them, he was far from alone in the heavens. Above all, he was still several centuries away from becoming the immaterial, incorporeal abstraction of later Jewish and Christian theologies. Instead, he was just like any other deity in the ancient world. He had a head, hair and a face; eyes, ears, a nose and a mouth. He had arms, hands, legs and feet, and a chest and a back. He was equipped with a heart, a tongue, teeth and genitals. He was a god who breathed, in and out. This was a deity who not only looked like a human &ndash; albeit on a far more impressive, glamourous scale &ndash; but who very often behaved like a human. He enjoyed evening strolls and hearty meals; he listened to music, wrote books and made lists. He was a god who not only spoke, but whistled, laughed, shouted, wept and talked to himself. He was a god who fell in love and into fights; a god who squabbled with his worshippers and grappled with his enemies; a god who made friends, raised children, took wives and had sex. This portrait of God has not been lifted from obscure myths inscribed on long-abandoned clay tablets. It is drawn from the Bible itself &ndash; a book as complex as the deity it promotes, not least because the Bible is not a book at all, but a collection of books, falling into two parts. The first is the Hebrew Bible, known in Judaism as Tanakh, and in Christianity as the Old Testament, and it is an anthology of ancient texts, originally crafted as scrolls. Most of these texts are themselves complex compilations of diverse literary traditions, and the majority were composed between the eighth and second centuries BCE in Judah, a small southern polity in the ancient Levant &ndash; the region we know today as Palestine, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and western Syria. In the eighth century BCE, Judah was a kingdom captured by Assyria; at the beginning of the sixth century BCE, it was conquered again, this time by the Babylonians. By the fifth century BCE, Judah had become a Persian province, and in about 333 BCE, it was incorporated into Alexander the Great&rsquo;s vast empire. Some Hebrew Bible texts tell of Judah&rsquo;s changing political fortunes, while others are stories about legendary heroes and myths about the very distant past. Some are collections of oracles attributed to various prophets, and others are compilations of poetry, ritual songs, prayers and teachings. But none of these texts have reached us in their &lsquo;original&rsquo; form. Instead, all were subject to creative and repeated revision, addition, emendation and editing across a number of generations, reflecting the shifting ideological interests of their curators, who regarded them as sacred writings. It is this long process of creative curation that has given narrative shape to the biblical story of God&rsquo;s relationship with &lsquo;Israel&rsquo;, the people in whom he takes a special interest. The first five books of the Hebrew Bible tell of the founding of this relationship. Following the creation of the world and the great flood, God forges a covenant (or contract) relationship with the Israelites&rsquo; ancestors &ndash; Abraham, his son Isaac and grandson Jacob &ndash; promising them a multitude of descendants in return for their obedience, which is to be demonstrated primarily by their worship of him alone. When the Israelites find themselves enslaved in Egypt, God liberates them, tasking Moses both to lead them to the &lsquo;promised land&rsquo; of Canaan and to instruct them in God&rsquo;s teaching (torah) &ndash; the regulations which will shape their ongoing relationship with the deity, including instructions for the glorious temple they are to build in their divinely granted homeland. Collectively, these five books &ndash; Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy &ndash; are known as the Torah, and together they rework what were probably competing traditions about ancestors and origins into a broadly coherent narrative about &lsquo;Israelite&rsquo; identity. The crafting of the past is continued in the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings. Together, this second block of material tells of the conquest and settlement of Canaan and the reigns of the first Israelite monarchs: Saul, then David, who makes Jerusalem his capital, followed by Solomon, who builds God a temple there. These books continue with stories about the fracturing of the kingdom into two, after Solomon&rsquo;s death: Israel, in the north, and Judah, in the south. The fates of the kingdoms are traced, skipping briskly past the Assyrian defeat of the kingdom of Israel in the late eighth century BCE, and ending in the early sixth century BCE with the Babylonian conquest of Judah, the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of its elites to Mesopotamia &ndash; events depicted as a punishment from God for generations of religious malpractice. The biblical portrayal of the past resumes in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, which focus on the return of the exiles in the late sixth and fifth centuries BCE. In spite of their former transgressions, this group is now the divinely elected, &lsquo;purified&rsquo; remnant of the ancient people of God &ndash; a notion similarly expressed in some of the prophetic works dating to this period. Restored to divine favour and back in the homeland, they rebuild Jerusalem and its temple, and recommit themselves to the divine teaching Moses had mediated. Historically, only the later episodes of this biblical story broadly dovetail with known realities, at best consigning Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and even David and Solomon, to the realms of fable &ndash; and at worst, to sheer fantasy. But from the ninth century BCE onwards, archaeological evidence points to the existence of the separate Iron Age kingdoms of Israel and Judah, and corroborates the names of some of their kings. Mesopotamian records confirm the Assyrian destruction of Israel in the late eighth century BCE, and the Babylonian defeat of Judah in the early sixth century BCE; Mesopotamian annals also attest to the forced migration of some higherstatus groups from both kingdoms &ndash; a common imperial strategy designed to curtail local uprisings in conquered territories &ndash; and there is sufficient evidence to suggest that some deportees did indeed return from Babylonia to Judah in the late sixth or early fifth century BCE. 4 But non-biblical material can also flag the limitations of the Bible&rsquo;s portrayal of the past, warning us that it cannot be taken as a comprehensive or reliable &lsquo;record&rsquo; of history. In the books of Kings, for example, a ninthcentury BCE ruler of the northern kingdom of Israel, named Omri, is presented as a figure of marginal significance, whose only noteworthy accomplishment is the founding of a new capital city, Samaria. But an inscribed stela set up by Mesha, king of neighbouring Moab, celebrates the regaining of sizable Moabite territories from &lsquo;Omri king of Israel&rsquo; and his successor, both of whom had &lsquo;oppressed Moab for a long time&rsquo;. The longevity of Omri&rsquo;s territorial and dynastic legacy is also reflected in Assyrian texts of the ninth and eighth centuries BCE, in which the kingdom of Israel is frequently designated &lsquo;Omri-land&rsquo; and its various kings as &lsquo;sons of Omri&rsquo;. The possibility that the Judahite writer of the books of Kings has not only minimized but suppressed Omri&rsquo;s significance is signalled by an oblique, fleeting reference to &lsquo;the rest of the acts of Omri, and the power that he showed&rsquo;. The partisan perspectives of the biblical writers and editors are also evident in an overarching insistence that the Jerusalem temple served as the only &lsquo;legitimate&rsquo; site of Yahweh worship. Other ritual sites are downplayed as mere shrines, or disparagingly dismissed as idolatrous, and are said to have been closed down by especially virtuous kings of Judah. And yet archaeological evidence corroborates the existence of several Yahweh temples throughout the first millennium BCE, including one in a statesponsored fortress in Arad, on Judah&rsquo;s southern border, dated to the eighth century BCE; another built by Judahite immigrants on the Egyptian island of Elephantine in the fifth century BCE; and yet another, operating from the fifth to the second centuries BCE, on Mount Gerizim in the West Bank. Scholars are agreed that the religious realities of Yahweh worship were far more diverse, and far less centralized, than the biblical story asserts. To put it bluntly, the Hebrew Bible offers a highly ideological and frequently unreliable portrayal of the past. It is a story told from the perspective of pro-Jerusalem writers and editors, for it was the trauma of Judah&rsquo;s conquest in the sixth century BCE, and Jerusalem&rsquo;s gradual regeneration in the Persian era, that triggered the literary activities giving rise to the texts of the Hebrew Bible as we find them today. With the restoration of the city&rsquo;s temple, which served as both a religious and administrative centre, Jerusalem&rsquo;s priestly and scribal cultures flourished. During this &lsquo;Second Temple&rsquo; period, old texts were reshaped and new literary works were crafted &ndash; and much of this literature was filtered through the lens of exile, return and restoration. But although these texts tend to present the exile and return as the experience of all Judahites, this was not the case. Only the elites and some among the professional classes had been deported to Babylonia, and the majority remained there. Meanwhile, other Judahite groups had already migrated to Egypt during the years of political upheaval, and many more would relocate to towns and cities along the prospering trade routes criss-crossing the eastern Mediterranean, Mesopotamia and the Levant. As the cultural contours of the imperial landscape shifted to Persia and then to Greece, Aramaic and Greek became the dominant literary languages of Jewish communities (as those of Judahite descent had come to be known). Consequently, by the beginning of the Common Era, many Jewish groups outside Roman Palestine &ndash; and some within &ndash; were reading and hearing their sacred texts in Aramaic and Greek translation. Among them were members of the Jesus movement &ndash; a minor Jewish cult, whose adherents believed their executed teacher had resurrected, heralding the imminent arrival of the Kingdom of God and the universal justice and peace it would bring. The movement had emerged in Roman Palestine, but was recruiting devotees from both Gentile and Jewish communities across the empire. Although we know it better as Christianity, this movement would ostensibly remain a Jewish sect for several generations, and its members quite naturally regarded the texts we now find in the Hebrew Bible as their own sacred scriptures. Like other Jewish groups, the earliest Christians also produced their own writings, including those that would eventually comprise the New Testament. Written in Greek between the mid-first and early second centuries CE, these texts quickly circulated around the empire. The earliest are letters written by Paul to Christian groups in cities across the eastern Mediterranean in the mid-50s, two to three decades after Jesus was executed, urging his readers to ready themselves for impending and miraculous change. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke (as they would soon be called) offer varied portrayals of Jesus&rsquo; life, supernatural powers and teachings, and were written in the closing decades of the first century, while John probably dates to about 100 CE. By the early second century CE, the other texts we now find in the New Testament had been produced, including some falsely attributed to Paul, others purportedly written by some of Jesus&rsquo; disciples, and the apocalyptic account of the expected cosmic transformation, known as the book of Revelation. These texts were far from being the only authoritative gospels, epistles and &lsquo;revelations&rsquo; circulating among early Christian communities, but they would become the most important. By the third century CE, they were increasingly being described as the new &lsquo;testament&rsquo; (or &lsquo;covenant&rsquo;) &ndash; a label indexing their elevated status as sacred writings both completing and eclipsing the old &lsquo;testament&rsquo; of Christianity&rsquo;s Jewish roots. Collectively known as &lsquo;the books&rsquo; (in Greek, ta biblia), the Bible would arguably become the most significant book in global history &ndash; and its deity the God of Western culture. God&rsquo;s body is nowhere denied in the Bible. It is simply assumed &ndash; whether or not mortals were privileged enough to catch a glimpse of it. And according to biblical texts, many were. Following their exodus from Egypt, a committee of Israelite elders had ascended Mount Sinai and seen first God&rsquo;s feet, then the deity himself. Among them, of course, was Moses, who is said to have enjoyed regular meetings with God, talking to him &lsquo;face to face, as one would speak to a friend&rsquo;. Moses is not the only one claimed to have experienced God&rsquo;s physical presence. In Genesis, Abraham walks alongside him, and Jacob has a wrestling match with him. In the books bearing their names, the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel each see God sitting on his throne, while Amos sees him standing in one of his temples. In the Gospels, Jesus not only boasts he has seen God, but is also said to have seated himself alongside God in the heavens, at his right hand. It is a companionable pairing reputedly witnessed by members of the Jesus movement, including a talkative young man called Stephen in the book of Acts, and the enraptured, if terrified, writer of Revelation, known as John of Patmos, both of whom see God sitting enthroned in the heavens, with Christ seated or standing next to him. In all these biblical stories, and many more besides, it was simply a given that God had a body. The sensational aspect in their telling was that God had allowed people to see it &ndash; such a rare privilege that, during the Second Temple period (c. 515 BCE &ndash; 70 CE), God was increasingly understood to have long hidden his body from the world, rendering it unseeable &ndash; and hence invisible &ndash; to most mortals. But an unseen body is not the same as a non-existent body. Underpinning the hiddenness of God was a religious regulation which had crept its way into earlier versions of the Ten Commandments in the Second Temple period: &lsquo;You shall not make for yourself a carved image, whether in the likeness of what is in the heavens above, or what is on the earth below, or what is in the waters beneath the earth&rsquo;. It is a striking insertion, for it suggests that material images of God were once a normative feature of Israelite and Judahite religion &ndash; otherwise there would be no need for the ban. And in this, Israel and Judah were no different from their neighbours, for &ndash; alongside other sacred objects &ndash; statues and figurines of deities had long played a part in south-west Asian religions. It was well understood that the gods were usually unobservable in their &lsquo;natural&rsquo; heavenly habitat. But they might deign to reveal themselves in the earthly realm as material images in a cult place (a site of worship). More than a symbol or representation, a cult image was a material manifestation of divine presence: the statue was not only identified with the deity, but was the deity. It is all too easy to dismiss this as a characteristic of unsophisticated or &lsquo;primitive&rsquo; religious cultures, but this is to misunderstand the people of the past &ndash; and their gods. This was a world in which perceptions of reality were neither limited nor defined by the physical, but stretched along a continuum from the natural to the supra-natural. The cosmic membrane separating the earthly from the otherworldly was highly porous and malleable, so that divinity in all its myriad forms could break through into the world of humans, whether it was perceived as a strange scent on the wind, a fleeting shape glimpsed from the corner of the eye, or felt at a powerful place in the landscape. But divinity was at its most tangible when materialized in images of the gods. It was by means of cooperation between deities and worshippers, facilitated by ritual experts, that the earthly substance of the statue was transformed into a different category of being. As ritual specialists in Mesopotamia had put it, the divine statue was &lsquo;born in heaven and made on earth&rsquo;. As extraordinary beings, deities were thus unconstrained: they could remain unseen and at a distance in the heavens while simultaneously revealing themselves as stars in the sky, statues in temples, figurines in the home, or unseen but perceptible forces permeating the earthly realm. The biblical ban on divine images is often held to signal the incorporeal nature of God, marking him out as a deity distinct from any other in the ancient world &ndash; a deity impossible to craft in clay or metal, wood or stone, by virtue of being bodiless. But the Bible&rsquo;s promotion of imageless worship indicates no such thing. The cults of various Egyptian, Assyrian, Babylonian and Phoenician deities all experienced periods of aniconic worship, despite the fact that these deities were understood to have bodies. The prohibition of divine images in the Ten Commandments points instead to a growing emphasis on the hiddenness of God&rsquo;s body, as a closely related tradition in Deuteronomy indicates. Here, Moses reminds the Israelites of their encounter with God on the way to the Promised Land, when they had gathered at the foot of the holy mountain in the wilderness to listen as the deity spelled out the terms of the covenant. Having descended onto the mountaintop, God himself was veiled from view, for all the Israelites could see was the heavenly fire and dark cosmic cloud shrouding the mountain&rsquo;s peak. &lsquo;Since you saw no form when Yahweh spoke to you from the middle of the fire&rsquo;, Moses says, &lsquo;watch yourselves very closely, lest you act corruptly by making a carved image for yourselves&rsquo;. In this text, the imageless worship of God was to be preferred to creating a statue of a deity the Israelites hadn&rsquo;t actually seen, but had only heard speaking. This emerging theological emphasis on the hiddenness of God would eventually give rise to the abstract, incorporeal deity of Judaism and Christianity &ndash; a deity no longer shrouded by fire and clouds, but only wondrous, inscrutable mystery. But Judaism and Christianity are postbiblical religions, and their disembodied deity is a later reimagining of a god who was far from enigmatic. For the God of the Bible was a deity who not only had a body, but a personal name, a backstory, a family and a host of companions in the heavens. Curriculum Vitae God&rsquo;s real name is Yaho. Or Yahu. Or perhaps just Yah. It is impossible to know for sure, because the original, Hebrew-speaking devotees of this god used a writing system comprising only consonants, much like modern Hebrew and Arabic today. And so in ancient inscriptions, the deity&rsquo;s name appears only as &lsquo;Yhw&rsquo;, &lsquo;Yh&rsquo; and &lsquo;Yhwh&rsquo;, leaving us uncertain as to how it was vocalized. It is the longer form, &lsquo;Yhwh&rsquo;, that is more commonly found in the ancient Hebrew literature of the Bible, but although many of these texts would be read aloud in worship, it remains difficult to know how the name was pronounced, for by the third century BCE, when this deity had already been venerated for centuries, it had become unutterable: a name too dangerous and powerful for human mouths to articulate. But later scholars in the Graeco-Roman world would have no such scruples. They appear to have vocalized it as &lsquo;ya-we&rsquo; or &lsquo;ya-ve&rsquo;, and so &lsquo;Yahweh&rsquo; is the name by which this deity has come to be known. Given the thorough-going theological revision of the literature which now forms the Hebrew Bible, Yahweh is often assumed to have been a distinctively solitary deity, devoid of divine colleagues and a family. But the religious realities of his early history were very different. As one of many deities in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age Levant, Yahweh was originally a god rooted within a polytheistic world &ndash; and remained comfortably so for much of his early career. This was a world in which the gods were imagined as a sprawling heavenly household, broadly reflecting the family bonds and social structures of their human worshippers. In most Levantine societies, this pantheon was headed by the aged progenitor of the cosmos, the god El or (in some dialects) Il &ndash; a name functioning both as a proper noun and the generic Semitic term for &lsquo;deity&rsquo;. Beneath him were ranked a younger generation of gods, each charged with a particular portfolio in the management of the universe &ndash; from storms, seas, sunlight and starlight, to fertility, birth, warfare and death. As frontline deities, these were the most prominent gods of ancient Levantine societies, and those most closely tied to the political and territorial identities of their worshippers. Thanks particularly to a wealth of literature dated to the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries BCE, recovered from the remains of an ancient city-state called Ugarit, on the Syrian coast, El&rsquo;s multi-tiered household has come into sharper focus. He was understood to be the gentle father of the gods, enjoying a comfortable semi-retirement from the day-to-day running of the cosmos, accompanied by his consort, the mother goddess Athirat. Between them, they had &lsquo;seventy sons&rsquo; &ndash; a collective term for the frontline deities. These included Ugarit&rsquo;s special patron, the powerful storm-god Baal, and his sister Anat, a fearsome warrior, as well the boisterous sea-god Yam and the underworld king of death, Mot, each of whom dwelt in his own domain located at the very edge of the divine realm. Ranked beneath them were the relatively minor deities of practical skills and cultural arts, including architecture and design, healing, music and magic, while below them was a collection of divine attendants and messengers, who variously served the gods and commuted between the heavens and the earthly realm. Despite their differences in rank, the gods met together as a divine council or assembly, chaired by El in his role as the highest god, to decide on matters both divine and mortal. Ugarit&rsquo;s pantheon was typical of Levantine religions in the late second and early first millennium BCE, when early forms of Yahweh worship emerged. The pantheon&rsquo;s shape and composition was determined by the very human idea that to be a god isolated from any other was to be bereft of the benefits of collaboration, status and kinship. In short, it was to be socially impotent &ndash; and frankly useless, therefore, to mortals. Against this cultural backdrop, certain theological claims asserting that Yahweh had only ever been a solitary deity look more than a little implausible. And the Bible itself reveals that this god was far from alone. A fragment of ancient poetry in the book of Deuteronomy not only locates Yahweh within a pantheon, but also reveals exactly who his father was. It describes the separation of humans into distinct groups (&lsquo;peoples&rsquo; or &lsquo;nations&rsquo;), and explains why each group was allocated a particular deity to act as its special patron. But the deity supervising this division of divine labour is not Yahweh, but Elyon &ndash; a title of El reflecting his role as the &lsquo;Most High&rsquo; god of the pantheon: When Elyon [&lsquo;Most High&rsquo;] apportioned the nations, when he divided humankind, he fixed the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the divine sons; for Yahweh&rsquo;s portion was his people, Jacob [Israel] his allotted share. Here, Yahweh appears as just one among El&rsquo;s many divine children. Other ancient pieces of poetry in the Hebrew Bible tell us something of Yahweh&rsquo;s early career. They too employ mythic motifs that run against the theological preferences of later biblical writers and editors, suggesting that they reflect older traditions about the earliest history of the biblical God. Far from portraying Yahweh as the supreme king and creator of the cosmos, they present him instead as a minor but ferocious storm deity, at the margins of the inhabited world, in an ancient place variously known as Seir, Paran and Teman &ndash; cast in the Bible as a dangerous, mountainous wilderness, seemingly located south of the Negev desert, beyond the Dead Sea, in what used to be called Edom and is now southern Jordan. As a god of such a place, Yahweh might have been akin to a group of disruptive deities known in the southern Levant as the Shadday gods &ndash; a name identifying them as deities of the &lsquo;steppe&rsquo; or &lsquo;wilderness&rsquo;. And naturally, they too were subordinate to El. A remarkable discovery at Deir &lsquo;Alla, the site of an ancient city in the eastern Jordan valley, offers a glimpse of these desert-dwelling deities. Inside a building destroyed by an earthquake in about 800 BCE, archaeologists found several fragments of a lengthy inscription, which had once adorned a plastered wall. Pieced together, it describes a series of visions received by a seer called Balaam ben Beor, who would later make a cameo appearance in the biblical book of Numbers as a prophet of El. The inscription reveals that a delegation of deities had warned Balaam that the Shadday gods had banded together against their high god, El, and were threatening to sew up the heavens in thick cloud, casting the world into darkness. &lsquo;So will be done, with naught surviving; no one has seen [the likes of] what you have heard!&rsquo; the gods declare to the panicked seer. While the heavenly rebellion and its associated cosmic calamity is typical of ancient south-west Asian myths, it is the portrayal of El as the heavenly overlord of the Shadday gods that is particularly remarkable, for it parallels one of the most prominent titles given to El in the Hebrew Bible. In Genesis, the god of the Israelite patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob is not usually named Yahweh, but El Shadday, as the deity himself insists: &lsquo;I am El Shadday&rsquo;, the God of the Bible announces to Abraham, &lsquo;I will make my covenant between me and you, and will make you exceedingly numerous&rsquo;. The deity makes a similar promise to Jacob: &lsquo;I am El Shadday! Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall spring from you&rsquo;. Traditionally (if mistakenly) translated as &lsquo;God Almighty&rsquo;, &lsquo;El Shadday&rsquo; means something like &lsquo;El of the wilderness&rsquo;, and appears to have been the name of a wellknown local manifestation of the great high god El in and around the territories identified today as Palestine, Israel and Jordan. It is El to whom Abraham, Isaac and Jacob build altars and make offerings in the land of Canaan, marking it out as the territory their divinely promised descendants will inherit. And it is El whom even these biblical writers recognize as being the god of their assumed ancestors. Scholars have long suspected that El, not Yahweh, was the original god of the people known in the Bible as &lsquo;Israel&rsquo;; his name not only occurs in the traditions of the patriarchs, but is embedded in the name of Israel itself (yisra-el), and is explicitly revealed in the divine name of a temple Jacob is said to have built at the ancient city of Shechem, in what is now the West Bank: &lsquo;He erected an altar there and called it &ldquo;El, god of Israel&rdquo; &rsquo;. Yahweh would gradually come to usurp his father El by supplanting him as the head of the pantheon. But quite how this happened remains frustratingly unclear. It is possible that the transition was tied to the socio-political conditions that gave rise to the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah early in the first millennium BCE. With kingship and statecraft came ideologies of militarized power &ndash; and the need for kings to exhibit themselves as warriors endorsed by fearsome divine fighters. As a storm god, Yahweh was naturally a god of warfare, equipped with weapons of thunder, lightning and rain clouds, and it was Yahweh&rsquo;s personal patronage the kings of Israel and Judah claimed. And as the patron deity of these kings, so Yahweh became the tutelary god of their small kingdoms, and the deity increasingly promoted at the ancient temples and sanctuaries within their bounds, whose economic and ritual heft further enabled and enhanced the performance of royal power. While this might account for the political prioritization of Yahweh, and even the deity&rsquo;s acquisition of some of El&rsquo;s traditional roles, titles and sanctuaries, it is still unknown exactly how or when Yahweh came to be understood as the head of the pantheon &ndash; and it is impossible to say whether or not this view of the pantheon was shared by ordinary Israelites and Judahites, for whom the religious ideologies of statehood remained relatively unimportant. What is more certain is that cultural memories of El&rsquo;s traditional role persisted, suggesting they remained too potent, or too deeply ingrained, to be ignored or excised from the religious traditions on which biblical authors and editors subsequently drew. Instead, a different theological strategy was employed: in a spectacularly transparent attempt at spin-doctoring, some writers sought to downplay Yahweh&rsquo;s apparent supplanting of his mythic father by insisting that Yahweh was El all along: &lsquo;I am Yahweh&rsquo;, the deity says to Moses, in Exodus. &lsquo;I appeared to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as El Shadday, but by my name Yahweh I did not make myself known to them&rsquo;. Yahweh&rsquo;s origins might well be murky, but by the ninth century BCE, he was firmly established as the head of the local pantheons of two kingdoms located in the territories belonging today to modern Israel and Palestine: Judah, with Jerusalem serving as its capital, and, to its north, Israel, governed primarily from the city of Samaria, the impressive remains of which are located in today&rsquo;s West Bank. Of the two, the kingdom of Israel was by far the stronger: with ten times the people power of Judah, its flourishing economy was rooted in the fertile soils of its hilly spine and lush lowlands, which together produced the olive oil, wine and wheat on which its economy and trade depended. Israel was a relatively prominent player on the southern Levantine stage, while Judah was often little more than its smaller, weaker, poorer neighbour. These kingdoms were just two of a number of regional polities, among them the Philistines, who lived along the coast of present-day southern Israel and the Gaza Strip; the kingdoms of Ammon, Moab and Edom, in what is now modern Jordan; the Phoenicians, whose principal cities now lie within modern Lebanon and coastal southern Syria; and the Aramaeans, who dominated much of the rest of Syria. By the eighth century BCE, these peoples were subsumed within the vast expanse of the Assyrian Empire, which now stretched from its Mesopotamian homeland in today&rsquo;s Iraq to encompass the lands we now know as Iran, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan. But the imperial subjugation of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah did not dislodge the cultural characteristics indigenous to these small southern Levantine societies. Within both kingdoms &ndash; which shared not only an oftcontested border, but a language (Hebrew), treaties and trade agreements, similar social and religious practices, and myths about common ancestors and gods &ndash; Yahweh was acclaimed as the &lsquo;national&rsquo; or state deity, and the divine patron of each kingdom&rsquo;s royal household. A number of other deities, who likely played their part in the polytheistic governance of the cosmos, were worshipped alongside him, with the most prominent among them being Yahweh&rsquo;s wife, the goddess Asherah. The biblical writers cannot help but reveal that she was worshipped alongside Yahweh in his temples in Jerusalem and Samaria, while inscriptions dating to the eighth century BCE attest to worshippers seeking blessings from &lsquo;Yahweh and his Asherah&rsquo;. This goddess was a local iteration of one of the oldest deities in the Levant, beloved for millennia by numerous societies across the region. Indeed, her name betrays something of her former life: &lsquo;Asherah&rsquo; is the Hebrew version of &lsquo;Athirat&rsquo;, the name of the mother of the gods at Ugarit &ndash; and El&rsquo;s consort. It would appear that, in supplanting his mythological father, Yahweh also took his wife. While the domestic arrangements of this biblical Oedipus might have been perfectly straightforward for an ancient deity and his worshippers, they would prove intolerable for later biblical writers, who engaged in so determined a campaign of defamation against the goddess that she would come to be locked out of the heavens forever. Historically, the goddess&rsquo;s fall broadly reflects the decline of traditional, state-sponsored polytheism &ndash; a decline triggered by the Assyrian annihilation of the kingdom of Israel in about 722 BCE, and the Babylonian destruction of Judah in 587 BCE. As patron deity and divine warrior of his peoples, Yahweh had seemingly failed to protect them. It would prompt a profound theological and cultural shift among certain priestly and scribal groups, some of them in exile, whose work would begin to shape the central traditions reflected in the Hebrew Bible, and eventually craft a new image of their god &ndash; the deity who would become the God of the Bible. Despite the destruction of his kingdoms, Yahweh himself had not been defeated, they insisted. Rather, he had engineered the collapse of the states of Israel and Judah in punishment of his worshippers&rsquo; religious deviancy: the worship of other gods. Yahweh would come to be presented as a god intolerant of other deities, and Yahweh worship would become increasingly monolatrous. Readers of the Bible might be surprised by this brief historical overview of Yahweh&rsquo;s early career. After all, the ancient editorial voices dominating the biblical portrayal of the past insist on a competing, alternative story, in which it is claimed that, from the beginning, God was only ever a solitary, unchanging deity, devoid of divine colleagues; a universal being in exclusive command of the cosmos, its course and its creatures. But this story is a product of a later theological worldview &ndash; and its narrative of religious history is unreliable. The texts that form the Bible were never intended to be a coherent account of the past, and they do not agree on either the central features or the smaller details of the religious landscape they present. Just as an atlas can only offer a constructed version of the world, compiled from a selection of political, cultural and social preferences (the changing names and borders of nations; disused quarries and railway lines) and frozen moments in time (the shifting shapes of coastlines, ice caps, forests and deserts), so too the Bible comprises a diverse collection of material, crafted and reworked over time with the force and flux of competing ideologies. By mapping God&rsquo;s body, rather than the Bible itself, we can better navigate the transformation of this ancient southern Levantine deity into the God with whom we are now culturally more familiar. Despite the theological changes wrought by the emergence of ancient Judaism and early Christianity, the one aspect of this deity that remained unchanged was his corporeality. By virtue of having a body, he endured as a powerful social agent in the lives of his worshippers across the centuries of the Bible&rsquo;s formation. In exploring the body of this ancient deity as his worshippers imagined him, we can access their world. We can meet the real God of the Bible. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.5sn8qc8mjfpo"><span class="c6">PART ONE- FEET AND LEGS</span></h2><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.fv7mf89lnk50"><span class="c4">Chapter 2 </span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0">GROUNDED</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A little over forty miles north-west of Aleppo, in northern Syria, set high above a valley, there lie the remains of a gateway to heaven: an ancient temple, the meeting place of the heavenly and earthly planes. A colossal carved lion, its teeth and claws bared, guards the approach. Surrounded by walls of black basalt, its floor paved with pale flagstones, the temple is the dwelling place of a long-lost deity, worshipped by the Syro-Hittites &ndash; close cultural cousins of the ancient Israelites and Judahites. Partially destroyed in the eighth century BCE, and devastated again in a Turkish airstrike in 2018, this temple at &lsquo;Ain Dara is the closest we can come to the temple that stood in Jerusalem at the same time. Its structure and iconography map so precisely onto the biblical description of Solomon&rsquo;s temple, it is as though they shared the same divine blueprint. When I visited the temple in 2010, shortly before the war in Syria began, wild summer flowers dotted the grass at the temple&rsquo;s edges, dappling the feet of guardian beings and lions lining the base of its now broken walls. I took off my shoes and walked barefoot up the warm, shallow steps to the entrance of the temple&rsquo;s outer courtyard. And then I saw them: two giant footprints, each about a metre in length, carved into the limestone threshold; neatly paired, they were pointing into the temple. The toes and balls of each footprint were softly, deeply rounded, as though they had been pressed firmly into wet sand. I stepped into these enormous, yet delicate feet. They dwarfed my own. I was standing in the bare footsteps of a god. As I looked ahead of me, I could see the vastness of the deity&rsquo;s stride into the temple: the left foot had been imprinted again a few metres inside the temple, this time on the entrance to the vestibule; ten metres or so beyond that was the right footprint, inside the holy of holies &ndash; the innermost sanctum, where the deity dwelt (Plate 1). The god had arrived home, and I was there to witness it. This was the grand residence of a deity whose precise identity has long since been forgotten. But although this god would fade from view, their bodily presence was clearly marked by those giant footprints, travelling in just one direction: inside. There were no exiting footprints; no indication that the deity had left the temple. Rather, the footprints signalled the permanent presence of the god within. It is this sense of material presence that lies at the heart of ancient ideas about deities. The perceived reality of the gods was bound up with the notion that for anything or anyone to exist &ndash; and persist &ndash; is to be present and placed in some tangible form. It is to be engaged with and within the physical world. The footprints at &lsquo;Ain Dara communicated precisely this sense of placement. They marked the exact place of the deity within the world of humans. At this spot, where the heavenly and earthly realms met, the god was manifest and accessible to worshippers. The deity took on a social life. The power of the footprint to communicate complex ideas about social presence says as much about what it is to be human as it does about what it is to be a god. When we see footprints, we recognize them as material traces of being; a frozen moment of movement or stillness; a memorial &ndash; however fleeting &ndash; to a reality by which we configure ourselves in the world and with those around us. Footprints capture something of the extraordinary and the familiar about human life &ndash; the orchestrated and haphazard, the durable and flimsy. A toddler&rsquo;s excited footsteps imprinted in sand or snow. Celebrity shoe-prints set in concrete on Hollywood Boulevard. Muddy shoes accidentally tracked across a kitchen floor. The footprints of a group of Australopithecus afarensis, some of our earliest bipedal hominid ancestors, solidified in volcanic ash, three and a half million years ago, in Laetoli, northern Tanzania. The famous dusty bootprint of Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin on the surface of the moon. A footprint isn&rsquo;t simply a trace or a representation of the foot. It is a material memory of its owner treading upon the surface on which the print appears, conjuring the presence of the whole body &ndash; the whole person. Our feet are not simply the pedestals on which we stand, or the motors by which we move, but the foundations of our presence in the world. The impressions made by our feet have imprinted themselves into the religious cultures we have created. The footprints of gods and other extraordinary beings are celebrated and venerated all over the globe: divine or mystical beings are said to have left their footprints in rock art across Scandinavian and British sites of the Late Bronze and Iron Ages. On an island sacred to the ancient Inca in Lake Titicaca, separating Bolivia from Peru, the footsteps of the sun god Inti are displayed. In southern Botswana, the giant hunter Matsieng left his footprints in wet earth around a waterhole. The extent to which the footprint appears in the ritual settings of human communities across time and space is remarkable. Some of the earliest examples of divine footprints derive from the ancient sanctuaries of deities who once travelled the lands bordering the Mediterranean. According to Herodotus, the enormous footprint of Heracles could be seen in a rock by a river in Scythia &ndash; a print Lucian mockingly claimed to be bigger than the footprint of the god Dionysus, next to it. The Egyptian goddess Isis left impressions of her feet across the Graeco-Roman world: at Maroneia, in Greece, for example, her supersized prints appear alongside those of one of her consorts, Serapis. This divine couple is also invoked in a first-century BCE inscription upon a marble slab in Thessaloniki, beneath which the goddess has approvingly left her footprints. Such is the power of divine footprints that they often became sites of competing religious claims. Most famous, perhaps, is the depression in rock akin to an enormous footprint on Sri Pada, a high peak in south-central Sri Lanka. For Tamil Hindus, it is the print of Shiva, left as he danced creation into existence; for Buddhists, the footprint belongs to Gautama Buddha, who pressed his foot into a sapphire beneath the rock; for Muslims, it is the print left by Adam as he trod on the mountain following his expulsion from Eden; for Christians, it is the footprint of Saint Thomas, who is claimed to have brought Christianity to the region. Jerusalem, too, has its share of contested divine footprints. As he ascended to heaven, Muhammad is said to have left a single footprint upon the exposed spur of bedrock enshrined beneath the Dome of the Rock, in Jerusalem. But for Christian pilgrims and Crusaders of the medieval period, the footprint on this sacred rock belonged to Jesus, whose foot is also said to be imprinted on the Mount of Olives, where it has been venerated since at least the fifth century CE. 8 Whether the work of geological erosion, local folklore or ritual art, each of these footprints communicates something of both the earthiness and otherworldliness of a divine or holy being. As my own feet rested in the footprints of an ancient deity in Syria, I better understood why the biblical God is so frequently concerned with the placement of his feet &ndash; and why we find his footprints all over the Bible and the landscapes its texts describe. In Genesis, Adam and Eve hear Yahweh&rsquo;s footsteps approaching as he walks in the Garden of Eden; later in the same book, Abraham sees Yahweh standing with two other divine beings beneath a group of sacred trees, and subsequently goes for a walk with him. Soon after, Abraham&rsquo;s grandson, Jacob, encounters Yahweh standing next to him in a sacred space at Bethel. In the book of Exodus, Moses meets God several times. When he first sees Yahweh in his corporeal form, the deity is standing on a magical rock in the wilderness. Later, when Moses ascends Mount Sinai with a group of tribal elders, God is seen again &ndash; along with a stunning close-up of the heavenly floor on which his feet rest: Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up, and they saw the God of Israel. And under his feet there was something like a brick pavement of lapis lazuli, like the very heavens for clarity. When the biblical story moves to Jerusalem, God&rsquo;s feet are there, too. This time, they are surrounded by the fragrant trees of an Eden-like temple garden, which, Yahweh says, &lsquo;glorify where my feet rest&rsquo;. &lsquo;This is the place for the soles of my feet, where I will reside among the people of Israel forever&rsquo;, he declares of his temple in the city. It is the place to which generations of his worshippers would flock to encounter the presence of the divine. In the Bible, God&rsquo;s feet are crucial to his social existence &ndash; fundamental to his very being &ndash; and so they are the bodily features by which he often renders himself evident in the world. The force of his feet splits mountains. They shake the earth as he strides out from the desert. They crush the bodies of his enemies. They transform dust and dirt into holy ground. Like indelible tracks worn into the earth along ancient pathways, the precise locations at which Yahweh plants his feet impact the landscape: his surefooted presence in the earthly realm transforms a piece of ground into a place, and a place into sacred space. Almost four million years ago, three changes in the bodies of our primeval ancestors enabled us to climb down from the trees to live upon the ground: our brains grew larger and more powerful; our thumbs and fingers became more dexterous; and our spines, hips and legs changed shape and alignment, so that we could habitually walk upright on two feet. In the popular drama of human evolution, our brains and hands tend to play the starring roles, with the feet cast as supporting members of the anatomical ensemble. According to the usual script, habitual human bipedalism freed up the hands so that they could spend less time propelling our bodies about and more time working with the brain in carrying out increasingly complex tasks. It was with our hands and our heads that human animals conquered the world; our feet simply got us about. And yet, as the social anthropologist Tim Ingold argues, the relegation of our feet to mere motors was not simply a product of evolution. It was also a &lsquo;head-over-heels&rsquo; conceptual shift in European intellectual perception, millions of years later, brought about by the dominance of the stiff leather boot. With the invention of the boot came the enclosing of the foot, dulling its sensory capacities, limiting its use as a tool to grasp and manipulate objects, and distancing our feet from the ground. The pervasive presence of the booted foot altered Europeans&rsquo; bodily experience of the natural world &ndash; so much so, that, by the time human evolutionary theory had become firmly established in the modern West, the boot was already a colonial and cultural marker of &lsquo;civilization&rsquo;, along with chairs, pavements, military parade grounds and motorized vehicles, all of which elevated us away from the earthy messiness of the &lsquo;primitive&rsquo;, uncontrollable world. But as our feet lost touch with the ground, so we lost touch with our feet. By contrast, our religious ancestors were far more grounded &ndash; and so too were their gods. The deities of the ancient Levant kept their feet firmly planted on the earth, imparting something of the divine to the places at which they stood. Indeed, sacred space had long been marked by the material presence of supra-natural powers. Across the Levant, for thousands of years before Yahweh worship emerged, the presence of these supranatural powers was often manifested by standing stones. Heavyweight, hardy and enduring, and taller than they were wide, these roughly hewn stone slabs ranged in size from just a foot or so high to towering monoliths. They were erected into a standing position, singly or in small groups, at places of power in the landscape &ndash; locations deemed to mark magical points of access to other realms. Their upright stance transformed the &lsquo;natural&rsquo; stone into a social presence: the stone stood up like a person. By the Early Bronze Age (c. 3100&ndash;2000 BCE), standing stones could be found in a range of settings: at isolated, open-air locations at a distance from human communities; at outdoor locations on the outskirts of walled settlements; and inside buildings or compounds within settlements. Archaeologists are still uncertain about the precise ways in which these stones were understood to function during this period. What is more certain, however, is that, by the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000&ndash;1500 BCE), standing stones were identified with extraordinary beings: they marked the presence of deities, deified ancestors and other supernatural powers, who &lsquo;stood&rsquo; at places at which the membrane between the human realm and otherworldly planes was at its most permeable (fig. 2). The identification of standing stones with a divine presence continued throughout the Late Bronze Age (c. 1550&ndash;1200 BCE) and the Iron Age (1200&ndash;539 BCE). During this long period, these stones were common &ndash; though not uniform &ndash; features of temples and other ritual spaces across the southern Levant. Whether these sacred spaces were sited inside towns and cities, on their fringes, or at more remote locations in the wider landscape, their standing stones simultaneously monumentalized, memorialized and manifested the robust, grounded presence of the divine. Over thousands of years, the sturdy base of a standing stone implanted into the earth had gradually come to mark the presence of a deity or otherworldly being dwelling in the material world. And these very ancient ideas about divine presence played a crucial role in shaping the God of the Bible and the places at which he stood. Fig. 2. A row of standing stones, ranging in height from one to three metres, at the ancient site of Gezer, Israel. Set up in the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000&ndash;1500 BCE), the stones stood as a social group, materializing the presence of otherworldly beings or powers. The squat block in the foreground is a large limestone basin, likely used in rituals. Standing stones populated the urban temples and outdoor sanctuaries associated with Yahweh worship, as archaeological excavations confirm. Some of these were very ancient, as at early Iron Age Shechem, near modern Nablus in the West Bank. Here, three stones had already stood for several centuries in a large fortified cult place; although it is now broken, the largest of these is estimated to have been almost three metres high. Others were more recent installations. Within a Judahite fortress at Arad, in the Negev desert, an eighth-century BCE temple dedicated to Yahweh contained a standing stone almost a metre tall, originally decorated with red pigment (fig. 3). At the same time, a sanctuary just inside the city of Dan, in the very north of the neighbouring kingdom of Israel, contained several groups of standing stones, some accompanied by incense burners and the bones of sacrificial animals. These sites represent just a handful of those exhibiting standing stones in their cult places, demonstrating that they were a familiar presence across the religious landscape. Today, these stones might look unexpectedly modest &ndash; even a little undignified &ndash; for time has stripped them of all but the barest traces of their social lives. But something of their sacred presence and numinous power can be seen on two coins from the Phoenician cities of Tyre and Byblos, in what is now Lebanon. Although these coins were minted in the Roman period, both exhibit far older Levantine religious motifs: one shows a standing stone enshrined within a high-status temple courtyard; the other depicts a pair of standing stones beneath a sacred tree, an offering of incense burning on an ornate brazier before them (fig. 4). Fig. 3. Jerusalem&rsquo;s Israel Museum is now home to the inner sanctum of an eighth-century BCE temple dedicated to Yahweh, uncovered during excavations at Judah&rsquo;s fortress town of Arad. The standing stone bears faint traces of red pigment. In the foreground are two incense altars. Fig. 4. Drawings of two third-century CE coins from Byblos (left) and Tyre (right). Both present standing stones in cultic settings. On the Byblos coin, the stone stands in a pillared temple precinct. The Tyrian coin shows a pair of stones on a platform, flanked by a sacred tree and an incense burner. Beneath them is inscribed the legend &lsquo;Ambrosial Rocks&rsquo;. Given their ubiquity across the Levant, it is no surprise to find that the biblical writers were well acquainted with standing stones. More significantly, the terminology they use to refer to these objects and their cult places reflects the age-old association of the standing presence of the divine and sacred space: in the Hebrew Bible, a standing stone is called a massebah, derived from the word meaning &lsquo;standing&rsquo;, while a sacred location at which these stones were placed is a maqom, a term commonly translated &lsquo;place&rsquo;, but which more precisely means &lsquo;a standing place&rsquo;. This specialized religious terminology is artfully employed in a highly idealized account in Genesis about the supposed origins of a temple at Bethel &ndash; a sacred site located atop a small mountain within the wider environs of what is now Ramallah, in the West Bank. Dating to at least the Middle Bronze Age, the site&rsquo;s biblical name betrays its very ancient and prestigious origins: &lsquo;Bethel&rsquo; tends to be translated as &lsquo;House of God&rsquo;, but it more literally means &lsquo;House of El&rsquo;, suggesting it was a temple originally sacred to Yahweh&rsquo;s predecessor. As with many other religious sites and stories, however, it was later claimed by Yahweh worshippers as their own, giving rise to a legend in Genesis, in which the temple is founded by one of the great ancestors of Israel, Jacob. As he travels through the promised land of Canaan on a quest for a wife, Jacob beds down for the night in the open, using a slab of stone as a large pillow. He dreams, and sees a staircase (not a ladder) on which messenger gods are travelling up and down between the earth and the heavens &ndash; a clear indication that this is a place at which humans can access the divine. Suddenly, Yahweh is standing next to him. He introduces himself as the ancestral deity of Jacob&rsquo;s forebears, Abraham and Isaac, and promises blessings of perpetual fertility and immovable territory in return for allegiance from Jacob and his descendants. When he awakes, Jacob realizes he has been sleeping in the dwelling place of the deity. &lsquo;Yahweh is in this standing-place!&rsquo; he exclaims, giddy with the tremulous zeal of the newly converted. &lsquo;How awesome is this standing-place!&rsquo;* He sets up the rock on which he slept as a standing stone (massebah), anoints it with sacred oil and pledges to make offerings to Yahweh there. At Bethel, Yahweh not only stands in the place marked by a standing stone, but identifies with the stone itself: &lsquo;I am the god of Bethel, whom you anointed there in the massebah&rsquo;, he later reminds Jacob. Today, the ancient temple at Bethel is lost to pilgrims, tourists and archaeologists, for much of the ancient city lies hidden beneath the longestablished West Bank town of Beitin &ndash; one among many towns and villages caught up in bitter territorial disputes between primarily Orthodox Jewish settlers and local Palestinian communities. But ancient Bethel was long known to have been one of the most authoritative and prosperous religious sites in the region throughout the Iron Age and well into the Roman period. Consequently, its temple was also a fierce competitor to its near neighbour in Jerusalem. Only a little over ten miles apart, the temples in Bethel and Jerusalem were powerful political and economic hubs located in related but rival territories during the first half of the first millennium BCE: Bethel, in the punchy kingdom of Israel and &ndash; later &ndash; the Assyrian province of Samerina, was a sanctuary of prestigious ancestral pedigree under the administrative patronage of the state, while Jerusalem, of course, was the capital of the smaller, weaker kingdom of Judah, and its temple served as the ritual powerhouse of the ruling Davidic dynasty. As high-status political and economic centres, as well as important cult places, Bethel and Jerusalem each relied on Yahweh&rsquo;s footfall to maintain their position as the powerful &ndash; and profitable &ndash; place at which the deity was present. Bethel might have boasted of being the standing place of God, but Jerusalem countered with the claim it was the place at which God had chosen to permanently rest his feet. It is a claim reflected in Yahweh&rsquo;s biblical assertions that the Jerusalem temple was &lsquo;my sanctuary, the place of my feet&rsquo; and &lsquo;the place for the soles of my feet, where I will reside forever&rsquo;. But these were not expressions of quiet, restful domesticity. They were proprietorial: whether divine or human, feet communicated ownership and identity throughout ancient south-west Asia. And the God of the Bible used his to stamp his authoritative presence onto the world of his worshippers. Underfoot In a world in which writing tended to be the preserve of scribal guilds, religious specialists and the elites for whom they worked, cylinder seals, stamp seals, tokens and amulets were frequently used as markers of identity, functioning in ways not dissimilar to our own personal signatures, PIN numbers and fingerprints today. For wealthier members of society, small stone or bone seals comprising images or a few words were pressed or rolled into wet clay to validate legal documents and movable property, such as storage jars of wine, olives and grain. Whether prosperous or poor, however, people&rsquo;s clothing, sandals, or body parts also served a similar function. Clay tablets from the Late Bronze Mesopotamian town of Nuzi, in the northern reaches of modern-day Iraq, illustrate the ways in which children&rsquo;s footprints were used as items of identity and exchange. Dated to between 1500 and 1350 BCE, some of them are imprinted with the feet of &lsquo;ownerless&rsquo; children (foundlings and orphans) alongside a record of their newly assigned parents, marking the adoptive family&rsquo;s responsibility for the child and the child&rsquo;s new social identity. At about the same time, in Emar, a city on the upper Euphrates in what is now Syria, the young children of impoverished families might also have been pawned or sold into servitude, or given over to local businesses by means of a similar process. Records from Emar reveal this is precisely what a woman called Ku&rsquo;e and her husband, Zadamma, had to do. Unable to feed their family, they sold their two-year-old daughter, year-old twin boys and a baby girl to a religious specialist called Baal-malik, who paid a mere sixty shekels for the children and later appears to have trained the two boys to be diviners. Clay tablets recording the sale are accompanied by further tablets, each impressed with a child&rsquo;s footprint and a record of their name, serving as contracts of receipt for Baal-malik. These children&rsquo;s feet quite literally marked their new social identities. Property sales, too, might also be accomplished by means of the foot. In several Mesopotamian cities, tracts of land were transferred in a series of legal rituals which included references to the seller raising a foot from the parcel of land to be released, and the buyer setting a foot on the land to claim its new ownership. Similar practices are reflected in the Bible, in which land is taken by walking upon it, or transferred to another by the seller removing a sandal and symbolically giving it to the buyer. In some traditions, a dead man&rsquo;s land &ndash; and the womb of his widow &ndash; might be contracted or released by his kinsman by means of similar sandal rituals conveying his social and legal right to claim ownership and occupancy of his dead kinsman&rsquo;s property. These body rituals underlie the dominant territorial ideologies of the Bible, in which God vows to give the land of Canaan to the Israelites: in Deuteronomy, Yahweh promises the Israelites that &lsquo;every place where the soles of your feet tread will be yours&rsquo;; in Genesis, he commands Abraham to &lsquo;walk through the length and breadth of the land&rsquo; of Canaan, &lsquo;for I will give it to you&rsquo;. The proprietorial function of Abraham&rsquo;s striding feet is a function shared with a divine figure properly known as &lsquo;the Satan&rsquo; (&lsquo;the Accuser&rsquo;), God&rsquo;s minister of justice in the book of Job, whose task it is to &lsquo;go to and fro on the earth&rsquo; and &lsquo;walk up and down on it&rsquo;, policing its inhabitants and punishing those unfaithful to God.5 In each of these verses, the biblical writers are deliberately engaging in the rhetoric and performance of political power &ndash; all prosecuted via the feet. For thousands of years, from the early third millennium BCE and continuing into the Roman era, the acquisition of lands by means of conquest was regularly publicized in royal inscriptions across south-west Asia and the eastern Mediterranean, describing a king &lsquo;setting his foot&rsquo; or &lsquo;bringing down&rsquo; his sandals on vanquished territories and their peoples. It is an idea beautifully illustrated on the inner soles of King Tutankhamun&rsquo;s ceremonial sandals, which are decorated with gold-lined images of the trussed-up bodies of foreign enemies upon which he trod (Plate 3). Like the pharaoh, the biblical God also used his sandals to mark the subjugation of an enemy: &lsquo;On Edom I hurl my shoe!&rsquo; he boasts in the Psalms, refocusing what might appear to Western eyes as a divine temper tantrum into a violent act of territorial expansion into a neighbouring nation. Yahweh&rsquo;s shoes were not as ornate as Tutankhamun&rsquo;s, but they were no less authoritative. Cult images of southern Levantine gods suggest they usually wore delicate leather sandals not dissimilar to flip-flops. They might have been relatively simple in style, but the gods&rsquo; shoes were sandals of status. Unlike the fibrous or leather sandals worn by mere mortals, the purpose of divine shoes was not to protect the feet, but to highlight a deity&rsquo;s sure-footed power. The ideological, rather than practical purpose of divine footwear is evident in a small statue of one of Yahweh&rsquo;s immediate cultural predecessors &ndash; a high god from fourteenth-century BCE Hazor, in what is today modern Israel. Seated in ceremonial glory on a now-missing throne, the deity wears sandals accessorized with snazzy wedged heels, giving him an additional authoritative lift (Plate 4). Wedged sandals like these would also become the power shoes of choice for both the fearsome kings of the late Assyrian Empire and the divine beings who protected their thrones. In the British Museum, traces of pigments on the ninth-century BCE wall panels of a royal palace at Kalhu &ndash; better known as Nimrud &ndash; vividly attest to their force. Accessorized with blood-red soles, they were shoes of deadly dominion. Across ancient south-west Asia, the divinely derived power of royal feet had long been exhibited on iconographic monuments displayed in temples, palaces, and even on mountainsides, showing the successful king trampling the landscapes and bodies of the subjugated. One of the most dynamic examples is the victory stela of the formidable Mesopotamian king NaramSin (c. 2254&ndash;2218 BCE), grandson of the world&rsquo;s first emperor, Sargon of Akkad (Agade). Now in the Louvre, it was originally set up in the city of Sippar, in what is today Iraq, and is dated to about 2250 BCE. It monumentalizes Naram-Sin&rsquo;s defeat of a powerful people called the Lullubi, who dwelt in the eastern foothills of the Zagros mountains. NaramSin is depicted as a triumphant, muscular monarch, striding up a steep, rocky landscape towards the gods&rsquo; sacred mountain, above which the starburst emblems of the high gods glitter. As he ascends, his eyes fixed on the peak of the divine mount in the heavens, he pins the broken bodies of his barefooted enemies under his sandalled feet, his obedient troops marching in file below him. Naram-Sin is thought to have been one of the first Mesopotamian kings to declare himself divine, and the iconography of this stela vividly promotes his deification: godlike in stature, he dwarfs both his soldiers and enemies as he ascends from the earthly realm into the heavenly plane. Wearing the horned crown of the gods as he tramples the world into submission, he has become just like one of the deities who brought order to the universe by subduing the forces of chaos and disruption under their feet (Plate 2). The subjugation of chaos was one of the most widespread mythological themes of ancient south-west Asian religions. The creation of the world was frequently understood to have been the result of a divine battle against chaos &ndash; often personified as a gigantic and primordial seven-headed sea monster. Although the myth varied in its details across south-west Asian civilizations, its basic shape was the same: a fearless young warrior deity takes on the monster in hand-to-hand combat, each using an arsenal of cosmic forces and magical weapons to attempt to defeat the other. After a lengthy and brutal struggle, the monster is vanquished, the victorious deity trampling its body in an assertion of supremacy. In some traditions, the god then dismembers and rearranges the corpse, creating a carefully contained watery roof for the skies, which separates the heavenly realm from the earthly realm, and an aqueous cosmic floor to separate the earth from the underworld. Having imposed order upon chaos, the warrior deity is rewarded with kingship over the other gods, and his own temple. The best-known example of this mythic trope is found in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish, a masterpiece of the late second millennium BCE, in which the mighty god Marduk defeats the fearsome Tiamat, the ancient mother of the gods and embodiment of the primeval sea. Its vivid celebration of Marduk&rsquo;s victory displays the cosmic power of the god&rsquo;s trampling feet: He flung down her carcass, he took his stand upon it . . . The Lord trampled upon the frame of Tiamat, with his merciless mace he crushed her skull. He cut open the arteries of her blood . . . He split her in two, like a fish for drying, half of her he set up and made as a cover, heaven. He stretched out the hide and assigned watchmen, and ordered them not to let her waters escape. In the Bible, the battle is fought between Yahweh and the aqueous chaos monster, whose various names attest to its dangerously disordered, unbounded nature: Leviathan (&lsquo;Twisty One&rsquo;), Rahab (&lsquo;Overflow&rsquo;), Yam (&lsquo;Sea&rsquo;), Nahar (&lsquo;River-Flood&rsquo;), Tannin (&lsquo;Dragon&rsquo; or &lsquo;Sea Monster&rsquo;) and Tehom (&lsquo;Deep&rsquo;) &ndash; many of which are the same names given to Baal&rsquo;s watery arch-enemy in the older Ugaritic myths of the battle with disorder. In several biblical texts, Yahweh is praised for &lsquo;driving back&rsquo; Yam, &lsquo;breaking the heads of the sea monsters&rsquo;, &lsquo;piercing Rahab&rsquo;, &lsquo;smashing the heads of Leviathan&rsquo;, dismembering and &lsquo;cutting openings&rsquo; in the corpse of chaos &lsquo;for springs and torrents&rsquo;. According to the book of Job, this enormous watery monster has scaly skin akin to rows of tightly packed shields. Flames shoot from its mouth, scorching smoke pours forth from its nostrils, and when it sneezes, it flashes lightning. As it thrashes about and roars in might, the dragon makes its primal waters boil, whipping up a foam so thick it looks white-haired. It terrifies even the other deities in Yahweh&rsquo;s retinue. &lsquo;Are not even the gods overwhelmed at the sight of it?&rsquo; Yahweh asks. &lsquo;No one is so fierce as to dare stir it up &ndash; who can stand before it? Who can confront it and be safe &ndash; under the whole heaven, who?&rsquo; The answer to these questions, of course, is Yahweh, who subjugates the chaos monster by hooking it like a fish, filleting its body and trampling it under his feet. Elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, God follows up his victory over the monster by pinning its watery body beneath his throne in his temple in Jerusalem. &lsquo;Yahweh sits enthroned over the flood! Yahweh sits enthroned as king forever!&rsquo; went the ancient ritual refrain. Here, temple mythology dovetailed with a distinctly royal ideology: Yahweh was explicitly cast as a divine king, seated in glory in a throne room in his temple, the fearsome chaos monster now his subservient prisoner, its waters compelled to roar a hymn of praise to Yahweh&rsquo;s superior might: Yahweh is king, he is robed in majesty; Yahweh is robed, he is girded with strength; he has established the world &ndash; it shall never be moved. Your throne is established from of old, you are from everlasting. The river-floods have lifted up, O Yahweh, the river-floods have lifted up their voice; the river-floods lift up their roaring. More majestic than the thunders of mighty waters, more majestic than the waves of the sea, majestic on high is Yahweh!32 Echoes of the divine defeat of chaos reverberate throughout the Bible, as the mythic trampling, dissection and abuse of its watery form is recycled in other texts: in Exodus, Yahweh bisects the sea to enable Moses and the Israelites to escape Egypt; in the Gospels, Jesus walks like a god on raging waters; and in the book of Revelation, the archangel Michael battles a seven-headed dragon in the final apocalypse.3 Adopting and adapting the mythic motif of God&rsquo;s battle with monstrous chaos, these traditions demonstrate just how pervasive the ancient myth continued to be. Picking up motifs drawn from the Greek myth of Bellerophon&rsquo;s slaying of the Chimera, it would later find its way into the popular legend of Saint George and the dragon, and become a stock image of hellish turmoil in the wall paintings, tapestries and illuminated manuscripts of medieval Europe.4 But in the Hebrew Bible, the only proper place for chaos was beneath the feet of the deity enthroned in his temple in Jerusalem. The building itself was located on the deity&rsquo;s &lsquo;holy mountain&rsquo;, Zion, where the vast elevated plaza known in Jewish tradition as Har Habayit (&lsquo;Temple Mount&rsquo;) and in Islamic tradition as Haram al-Sharif (&lsquo;Noble Sanctuary&rsquo;) stands today. Even in the Iron Age, Zion was less a mountain and rather more a hill. But within the bounds of sacred topography, the temple&rsquo;s lofty location was mythic, rather than strictly geological. To step into any temple was to ascend into the heavenly sphere &ndash; the world of the gods, located in the skies atop a gigantic mythological mountain at the centre of the world. Rooted in the underworld, stretching up through the earthly realm and reaching into the heavens, this cosmic mountain was the vertical axis of the universe. It was commonly known in mythological and ritual texts across the Levant as the &lsquo;holy mountain&rsquo;, the &lsquo;mountain of the gods&rsquo;, or the &lsquo;mount of assembly&rsquo;, and was the site at which the gods gathered to feast, hold council meetings to debate the day-to-day running of the cosmos, and to enjoy the attentions of their worshippers. Whether sited on a mountain, a hill, a rocky outcrop, or even a raised, artificial platform, in the imagined realities of ancient Levantine religions, a temple was necessarily and schematically located at the apex of the cosmic mountain. It is for this reason that the God of the Bible, like his contemporaries across the sea on Mount Olympus, is often encountered on mountaintops. Be it Sinai or Horeb in the wilderness, Carmel, Tabor, Ebal or Gerizim in the highlands, or Zion or the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, divine presence is particularly associated with high points in the landscape and the mythological motif of the cosmic mountain. It is an idea beautifully expressed in a small poetic fragment embedded in the book of Amos, in which Yahweh&rsquo;s footsteps on the mountaintops demonstrate his dominion and his role as guarantor of cosmic order: For, look! The one who forms the mountains, creates the wind, reveals his plan to mortals, makes the morning darkness, and treads on the heights of the earth &ndash; Yahweh, God of Hosts, is his name!36 As a king enthroned on the cosmic mountain, Yahweh enjoyed the affectations of ancient, princely rule typical of many other deities across south-west Asia &ndash; including a permanent dwelling place of impressive quality. A high-status urban construction, sponsored by the local king and reflecting the religious worldviews of social elites, the Jerusalem temple had much in common with other Levantine temples of the second and first millennia BCE. Constructed of large stone blocks and sweet-smelling cedar (a favourite fragrance of many deities), temples were power structures for both humans and gods. Most were set on a large raised terrace, accessed by steps, and separated from the &lsquo;ordinary&rsquo; world by a walled precinct, into which gateways were cut. These gates opened onto an open-air courtyard, where animal sacrifices and other communal (and potentially messy) rituals were performed. In larger temples, courtyards might also contain sacred trees and plants, pens to hold sacrificial animals, and small workshops, where specialized temple crafts, such as pottery, weaving and herb processing, were carried out. Most Levantine temples were rectangular in shape, and accessed at the short, eastern side by more ascending steps, a twin-pillared porch and a large set of doors, which might be plated with bronze or other shiny materials to manifest the gleaming brightness of the heavenly realm. These gave entry to a large enclosed space, roofed with wooden beams and scented with incense and perfumed oils, within which more exclusive &ndash; and now mostly unknown &ndash; rituals were performed. In this space, usually at the very back of the building, behind a wall or screen, was an elevated chamber &ndash; the inner sanctum (known in the Bible as the &lsquo;holy of holies&rsquo;), where the deity&rsquo;s statue, standing stone or symbol was housed. Throughout the temple complex, including within the building itself, the walls and portals were covered with magical, protective symbols of cosmic fecundity. In the Jerusalem temple, these seem to have included sacred palm trees, pomegranates, rosettes and blossoming flowers, as well as images of lions, bulls and other powerful guardian beings. It was a place of intense multisensory stimulation for those privileged enough to enter. The monumentality and iconography of temple architecture served not only to glorify their human commissioners and the deities they honoured, but vividly demonstrated the imposition of the divinely inspired, humanbuilt environment upon unwieldy, uncultivated, &lsquo;uncivilized&rsquo; chaos. But the most important function of a royal temple was as a ritual space at which the presence of deities was not only marked, but maintained. And deities were very high maintenance. Their residences were not simply dwelling places, but divine palaces. The incumbent deity and their assembly of junior gods was attended by a household of &lsquo;servants&rsquo; comprising the temple priesthood, who prepared and served the deities&rsquo; meals (sacrifices and libations); diviners, prophets and cultic scribes, who smoothed the transmission of divine communication (speaking, interpreting and &lsquo;recording&rsquo; oracles and omens); and other priests and ritual functionaries, who washed, dressed and paraded the gods in the form of cult statues.Ideologically, if not literally, these temples might include enormous furniture for their supersized deities. In an ancient world in which big was beautiful, the gigantism of the gods and their temple furnishings was both an aesthetic delight and a theological virtue. It is for this reason that in the biblical portrayal of the Jerusalem temple &ndash; which in its details speaks more to the rhetoric of political prestige than historical reality &ndash; King Solomon is said to have provided Yahweh with enormous household furniture, attesting to the gigantic proportions of his body. These included a huge bronze altar for his sacrificial meals, measuring over thirty-two feet (twenty cubits) in length and breadth and more than sixteen feet (ten cubits) high, a vast water basin over sixteen feet in diameter (ten cubits), and ritual bowls for the god&rsquo;s oils and perfumes, set on stands more than eleven feet high (seven cubits).8 But the most important of pieces of furniture could be found in the temple&rsquo;s holy of holies. Here, two golden cherubim formed the giant throne on which Yahweh was said to sit. Far from being the winged chubby babies of Renaissance art, cherubim were frightening divine beings with the wings of an eagle, the body of a lion, a bull or a person, and a human-like face. Equipped with speed, strength and steadfast stubbornness, they served the gods as guardians, and could usually be found supporting the thrones of high gods and their nominated kings, and standing at the thresholds of temples (fig. 5). The Jerusalem cherubim are said to have stood a staggering sixteen feet high, matching their equally enormous wing-span of sixteen feet (ten cubits by ten cubits).9 Enthroned upon them, Yahweh&rsquo;s feet rested on the ark of the covenant &ndash; a box-shaped miniature shrine, cast as a golden pedestal, said to measure four feet long (two and a half cubits) and described in the book of Chronicles as &lsquo;the footstool of our God&rsquo;. The symbolic significance of this configuration of divine furniture is attested by its longevity and ubiquity in the religious art of the ancient Levant: royal gods and goddesses are commonly depicted sitting upon tall, ornate thrones in their temples, their feet resting neatly upon raised, solid-legged, square footstools. When the God of the Bible had declared the Jerusalem temple to be the place for the soles of his feet, he meant it literally. And his worshippers knew it, too: Fig. 5. Detail of an ivory plaque from the city of Megiddo, dated to about 1350&ndash;1150 BCE. It shows a king seated on a high-backed cherubim throne, his feet resting on a footstool. Egyptian in style, the cherub has the body of a lion, the wings of a bird of prey and a human-like face. Yahweh is king; let the peoples tremble! He sits enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake! Yahweh is huge in Zion; he is exalted over all the peoples . . . Extol Yahweh our god; worship at his footstool. Holy is he!41 Like the deity at &lsquo;Ain Dara in Syria, whose footprints were set in stone as they strode into their temple, the permanence of Yahweh&rsquo;s presence in the Jerusalem temple was made manifest by his feet. Enthroned in exalted glory, this was a deity exuding the confident, stable control of a cosmic king who had little need to rise from his seat; a powerful ruler who could sit and relax, his feet up on his stool, the forces of rebellion quashed under the soles of his shoes. That, at least, was the theological ideal. The religious reality was rather different. The political power play of gods and mortals would gradually come to loosen Yahweh&rsquo;s feet from their place in Zion &ndash; and worshippers would find themselves reminded that their deity was neither immovable nor immobile.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.phie10j9z6m7"><span class="c4">Chapter 3</span></h1><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">FOOTLOOSE In the drizzle of a gloomy day, the triumphal Arch of Titus on Rome&rsquo;s Via Sacra can look strangely sombre: the yellowed marble of its enormous frame darkens to a lacklustre grey, rendering its high-vaulted ceremonial archway a bleak and brooding empty space. But beneath the arch itself, the celebratory monument suddenly springs into life. Gods, people, animals and architecture burst out of the bas-relief friezes decorating the passageway. On one side, Titus stands in a chariot pulled by four magnificent horses, as Virtus and Honos, the divine personifications of military virtue and imperial glory, lead the chariot along the processional way. Behind Titus stands winged Victory, crowning him with the oak and acorn circlet of triumph as he gazes towards the political heart of ancient Rome. Originally painted in bright bursts of colour, the monument was erected to celebrate Titus&rsquo; emphatic defeat of a rebellious Judaea (Judah) in 70 CE, when he was still but a general, fighting under the command of his father, the emperor Vespasian. The spoils of his victory are depicted on the opposite frieze. Here, a throng of Romans jostle their way along the Via Sacra, struggling under the weight of the sacred swag looted from the Jerusalem temple: a golden table for ritual offerings, its cups still perched upon it; the silver trumpets of the temple&rsquo;s priests; and a huge golden menorah (fig. 6). Of course, the Romans were not the first to monumentalize the capture of sacred treasures from the temples of the defeated, nor indeed the first to glory in the violation of a deity&rsquo;s dwelling place. But it is the indignity inherent in the dynamic display on the Arch of Titus that distinguishes it from the visual propaganda of earlier imperial cultures; tottering on their makeshift pallets amid a crush of bodies, the Jerusalem temple&rsquo;s prized possessions are not so much glorious trophies, but objects of derision. The contrast with the celebratory art of the conquering kings of older cultures is striking. The mighty emperors of south-west Asia were no less triumphalist in their exhibition of looted temple treasures, and no less destructive in their despoliation of the divine, but they tended to afford a certain dignity to their sacred booty &ndash; publicly, at least. Ancient precursors to the iconography of the Arch of Titus can be seen on the monumental wall panels decorating the ceremonial rooms of late Assyrian palaces. Here, soldiers marching with regimented precision carry aloft their holy cargo with reverent care, as their comrades continue to bludgeon, butcher and burn their way through vanquished cities. They process towards their victorious king, who is often shown standing in his chariot or sitting on an ornate throne in front of his campaign tent, watching as the wealth of the fallen is paraded before him, his accountants keeping tally as temple treasures, civic booty, prisoners, refugees and animals file past. Fig. 6. The Arch of Titus, on Rome&rsquo;s Via Sacra, celebrates the imperial victory over a rebellious Judaea in 70 CE. One of its friezes shows the parade of sacred objects looted from the Jerusalem temple, which was razed to the ground. The huge menorah (left) and the offering table (right) were once painted in golden hues. The temple&rsquo;s elegant trumpets, criss-crossed in front of the offering table, appear to have been coloured silver. Fig. 7. Part of an Assyrian palace relief from Kalhu (Nimrud), dated to about 730 BCE, showing Levantine gods being conveyed out of their conquered city by victorious Assyrian troops. The cult statues offer a snapshot of the local pantheon: two enthroned deities are followed by a god hidden in a mobile shrine, and a warrior deity, who brandishes a bundle of lightning and a mace. A particularly vivid, though damaged, example of this scene is now in the British Museum. Dated to about 730 BCE, it commemorates the defeat of an unidentified Levantine city by King Tiglath-pileser III. The top register of the panel shows archers attacking the heavily fortified city, while troops hack at the brickwork. Striding past a pile of corpses, soldiers carry off sacks of loot and a couch from an affluent home, while another herds a terrified, skittish ox out of the city. The tumult of the Assyrian raid gives way to a solemn procession in the lower register. Marching two by two, troops convey the gods of the city into exile: carefully positioned on sturdy pallets carried on the soldiers&rsquo; shoulders, the cult statues progress in stately fashion towards their new home in Assyria. Four deities in the middle of the procession are shown: a fearsome warrior god, wearing a horned crown and brandishing his weapons, follows a deity housed in a box-like shrine; ahead of them are two enthroned deities, probably goddesses, clothed in the anklelength tunics of royal authority. Although their feet are partially obscured by their captors&rsquo; tall helmets, the towering height of the gods&rsquo; thrones indicates their feet remain appropriately elevated, their divine authority intact (fig. 7). In a world in which even the gods of other lands were considered dangerously powerful, these statues and their temple furniture are handled with a ritualized reverence. The gods might as well be going on tour to pay willing tribute to another deity in another temple &ndash; which is precisely the way in which the capture and exile of divine statues was so often couched in ancient south-west Asian texts and inscriptions. At the heart of this iconography is the widespread and deeply rooted sense that the imposition and maintenance of order in the earthly realm was a divinely ordained responsibility of kings, who imitated their patron deities by stamping out rebellious forces and upholding the hierarchical powerstructures built into the world at its creation. Mortal kings might have had their footstools kicked out from under them as they were pulled from their thrones and forced to prostrate themselves at the feet of a conqueror, but even in defeat, deities continued to be accorded the honour their exalted, enthroned status demanded. Across ancient south-west Asia, this social dynamic was borne out in the divine realm itself, where the footstool of an enthroned deity functioned as a prop in the bodily performance of power. Seated in glory on a high-legged throne, the footstool not only undergirded the deity&rsquo;s sure-footed presence in their temple, but emphatically elevated their feet above those of other gods and heavenly attendants who stood alongside them. This carefully staged configuration of divine bodies is well attested in the Bible, for it is what Yahweh&rsquo;s prophets are said to have seen. In a text drawing on traditions of the ninth century BCE, Micaiah ben Imlah declares, &lsquo;I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, with all the host of heaven standing to the right and to the left of him&rsquo;. Centuries later, God was still holding court in the same way: in the second-century BCE book of Daniel, the eponymous seer endures a terrifying but flamboyant vision of the deity sitting enthroned while &lsquo;a thousand thousands served him; and ten thousand times ten thousand stood attending him&rsquo;. Standing on ceremony in the presence of an enthroned deity was a crucial piece of courtly etiquette in the world of the gods. It was a mark of collegial, collaborative respect, and formally displayed a keenness to leap into action should the high god demand it. Accordingly, upon entry into the divine throne room, gods were expected first to kneel or prostrate themselves at the feet of the divine ruler, and then to stand in polite, ready attendance. Poor manners or a deliberate snub might trigger the most serious of punishments. A telling example of gods behaving badly is found in the Mesopotamian myth of Nergal and Ereshkigal &ndash; the earliest known version of which is dated to the fifteenth or fourteenth centuries BCE. When the goddess Ereshkigal, queen of the underworld, sends her official representative up to the heavenly realm to attend a banquet on her behalf, she is enraged to learn that one of the gods, the ambitious, cocky Nergal, refused to rise to his feet in the presence of her vizier. &lsquo;Bring him to me . . . that I may kill him!&rsquo; Ereshkigal commands. In a series of unsettling twists, Nergal descends to the underworld with an army, intending to behead the goddess and seize her throne. But as they grapple in the throne room, Nergal fiercely clutching fistfuls of the queen&rsquo;s hair, she suddenly offers to become his wife and to share with him her underworld kingdom. He relaxes his grip, and she weeps. He cries, and they kiss. He wipes away her tears, accepts her offer and is enthroned alongside her. As challenging as this myth is to the gender-alert sensibilities of modern-day readers, it underscores the ancient conviction that a deity&rsquo;s enthroned status was to be preserved at all costs. The Bible too betrays ancient anxieties about God&rsquo;s need to defend his throne from challengers. In a poem drawing on much older mythic tropes, a semi-divine tyrant named only as &lsquo;Day Star, son of Dawn&rsquo; ascends Saphon, a traditional name of the Levantine cosmic mountain, in an effort to unseat Yahweh in his role as the enthroned Elyon (&lsquo;Most High&rsquo;), the title inherited from El. As he strides up the holy mountain, the trespassing tyrant mutters to himself, revealing his plot: I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit on the mount of [the divine] assembly on the heights of Saphon; I will ascend to the tops of the clouds, I will make myself like Elyon!5 His punishment is swift. He is cast out of the heavens and down into the underworld, the place of the dead. His expulsion is a feature of the ancient myth Christianity later recycled in its story of Lucifer, the star-bright but rebellious &lsquo;fallen angel&rsquo; who is cast out of heaven to take up a new career as the Devil. But unlike Lucifer, who goes on to enjoy a heady existence in the underworld, the tyrant of this biblical poem is subjected to further punishment: his corpse is exhumed and abandoned &lsquo;like loathsome carrion&rsquo; to be trampled underfoot. Indeed, whether divine or human, no other body was fit, quite literally, for the throne and footstool of the king of the gods. At Ugarit, on the coast of Syria, the throne of Baal on Saphon was said to be so big that appointing his potential successor proves a challenge to the council of gods. The successful candidate must be a warrior of gigantic size and enormous strength, who can run as far and fast as Baal, and wield a lance with sufficient supernatural skill to defeat the most fearsome of cosmic enemies. But when the warrior god impressively named Athtar the Awesome is chosen to sit in Baal&rsquo;s place, he must suffer an embarrassing climbdown: as the other deities disappointedly exclaim, &lsquo;his feet do not reach its footstool, his head does not reach its top! &rsquo;7 Dangling feet, unfixed to their royal footstool, were dangerous in the power play of divine politics &ndash; after all, some gods were known to have been dragged from heaven by their feet. This was the fate of one of the oldest deities in the cosmos, Anu, the god of primeval heaven in Mesopotamian and Hittite cultures. According to a Hittite myth, Anu&rsquo;s son, Kumarbi, had spent nine years of obedient prostration at his father&rsquo;s feet when he decided to challenge Anu in his throne room. As Anu attempted to fly to the very tops of the heavens to escape, Kumarbi caught him by his heels, pulled him down by his feet and bit off his genitals. To lose a foothold in the divine realm was to be emasculated in the most visceral of ways. Echoes of the story found their way into Greek mythology, too. When Zeus takes the throne from his father, Kronos, who had supplanted and castrated his own father, Ouranos, he is challenged by the monster Typhon, who cuts the tendons from Zeus&rsquo; feet and hides them in a cave in an effort to unseat him. In some traditions, it is only when his tendons are retrieved and restored to his body that Zeus can finally secure his throne. Underlying these myths was the widespread notion that the back of the foot was a point of particular vulnerability and weakness in the body &ndash; as Achilles is said to have discovered during the fabled battle of Troy. Accordingly, the back of the foot was the place at which hierarchies of power might be disrupted. This idea finds expression in the Hebrew Bible, in which the common myth of divine usurpation is reworked in the story of Jacob, whose name means &lsquo;heel taker&rsquo; or &lsquo;supplanter&rsquo;. Born immediately after Esau, his twin brother, Jacob emerges from the womb gripping the heel of his older sibling, in an action prefiguring his later usurpation of Esau when he tricks him out of his birthright as firstborn. The book of Hosea pointedly draws a parallel with Jacob&rsquo;s attempt to take on God himself in a wrestling match at the River Jabbok: &lsquo;In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he strove with God&rsquo;. Whether a human, a hero, or a god, to keep one&rsquo;s feet fixed firmly in place &ndash; both spatially and socially &ndash; was to guard against a loss of status. One of the most vivid biblical accounts of divine usurpation is told in the books of Samuel. The story begins at Shiloh, in the West Bank, where one of Yahweh&rsquo;s oldest temples is thought to have been located. When the Israelites go to war against the Philistines, a formidable people living along Canaan&rsquo;s southern coast, they suffer such a catastrophic defeat that they send word to the Shiloh temple, and ask for Yahweh himself to join their ranks. &lsquo;Let us bring Yahweh&rsquo;s ark of the covenant from Shiloh, so that he may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies! &rsquo;11 As the footstool of God, the ark was not the wrath-filled box of Hollywood&rsquo;s Indiana Jones movie, but the pedestal on which the deity&rsquo;s feet remained fixed, even as his enthroned statue was processed about his temple &ndash; or indeed taken into battle. It is the cult statue of Yahweh that is envisaged by the biblical writers when they affirm that &lsquo;the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of Hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim&rsquo; duly entered the war camp. The arrival of the deity and his divine entourage (&lsquo;hosts&rsquo;) prompts such a rapturous response from the Israelite soldiers that the Philistines quickly realize what has happened. &lsquo;Gods have come into the camp!&rsquo; they cry. &lsquo;Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods?&rsquo;12 The answer, it soon transpires, is Dagan (in Hebrew, &lsquo;Dagon&rsquo;), one of the best-known deities across ancient south-west Asia. The Philistines not only succeed in defeating the Israelites, but capture the ark &ndash; and the deity enthroned above it &ndash; and carry it back to the city of Ashdod, where they ceremonially install it in Dagan&rsquo;s temple, next to his statue. As was common, the Philistines treated their sacred booty with a holy reverence. Yahweh might have been a prisoner of war, but his capture was cast as an opportunity to pay polite homage to Dagan. It was an opportunity Yahweh turned to his advantage. When the victorious Philistines return to the temple the next morning, they find Dagan flat on his face, prostrate before Yahweh&rsquo;s footstool. Lifting the divine statue from the temple floor, they restore it to its upright position. The following day, however, they were in for another shock &ndash; Dagan had not only fallen again, but was dismembered: &lsquo;the head of Dagan and both his hands were lying cut off upon the threshold; only the torso of Dagan was left to him&rsquo;. On the battlefield, Yahweh&rsquo;s sure-footed presence might not have won the day, but in the temple of Ashdod, in the dangerous darkness of the night, his footstool had become a weapon of war. Dagan had not only been floored by Yahweh, but &ndash; like a cosmic chaos monster &ndash; he had been trampled and dismembered, his body parts kicked to the very edges of the sacred realm. As both his footstool and a mobile shrine, Yahweh&rsquo;s ark was a part of his person seemingly external to his body, but barely distinguishable from him. The two were one and the same. When Yahweh moved, so did the ark. And when the deity came to rest, the ark did too, as one biblical writer explains, citing what appears to be an ancient incantation: &lsquo;Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say, &ldquo;Arise, O Yahweh, let your enemies be scattered, and your foes flee before you!&rdquo; And whenever it came to rest, he would say, &ldquo;Return, O Yahweh, to Israel&rsquo;s teeming myriads!&rdquo; &rsquo;14 Uncomfortable with the deification of the ark as the weaponized pedestal of Yahweh, other biblical writers endeavoured to disempower its agency by demythologizing its role. The ark was carried about in ritual processions, they agreed, and it had once led Yahweh&rsquo;s worshippers into battle, they confirmed, but it was merely a box shrine for the Ten Commandments: &lsquo;There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone that Moses had placed there&rsquo;. Written into the story of the founding of Yahweh&rsquo;s temple in Jerusalem, this little verse reads like special pleading. And it is at odds with the ritual refrain sung by worshippers as they watched what was likely a statue of their deity process about the city and into the temple: &lsquo;Rise up, O Yahweh, and go to your resting place, you and the ark of your might!&rsquo;16 The insistence that the divine footstool was actually a specialized &ndash; if sacred &ndash; container for holy writings marks a relatively early theological assault on the body of God, whose material presence, once manifest in the Iron Age temples of ancient Israel and Judah as a divine statue or cultic object, would gradually come to be replaced in ritual by the Torah. In synagogues, which emerged only during the latter half of the Second Temple period (c. 515 BCE &ndash; 70 CE), this displacement would come to be underscored by the small &lsquo;ark&rsquo; or shrine in which the Torah scrolls were housed, which took its name from the ark of the covenant. But cultural memories of the ark&rsquo;s original role as a divine footstool or pedestal appear to have persisted, as a remarkable artefact suggests. In 2009, excavations at Migdal &ndash; ancient Magdala &ndash; on the north-western shore of the Sea of Galilee revealed a large synagogue dated to the mid first century CE. In its main room was a squat, four-footed limestone block, beautifully decorated with relief carvings of iconographic and architectural motifs seemingly drawn from the Jerusalem temple. Along its longer sides are four arched gateways, flanked by columned pillars, within which stylized palm trees stand. On one of its shorter sides, two similar gateways each house a large rosette &ndash; a symbol taking pride of place between two more palms on the stone&rsquo;s top. Its other short side is decorated with two more columns, a pair of amphorae, and a large menorah, standing on or behind a square object which looks not unlike like the stone itself (fig. 8). Scholars remain uncertain as to the function of this extraordinary object, but some suspect it served either as a ritual pedestal for the Torah, or as a shrine modelled on the Jerusalem temple. However it is understood, its shape is remarkably evocative of the biblical footstool of God. For many, the permanent destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 CE meant that synagogues inevitably became the places at which God now set his feet. It was a view that would be endorsed in an anthology of early rabbinic interpretations of the book of Exodus, probably in circulation by the end of the fourth century CE, known as Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, in which it is claimed that &lsquo;wherever ten people congregate in the synagogue, the Divine Presence is with them, for it is written [in Psalm 82], &ldquo;God stands in the congregation of God&rdquo; &rsquo;. In Babylonia, then home to the largest population of Yahweh worshippers outside of Palestine, the synagogue of Shaf ve-Yativ in the city of Nehardea was said to have been built with the very dust and stones of the Jerusalem temple itself, where God had set his feet. The synagogue community could point to a scriptural precedent: in the books of Kings, an Aramaean general called Naaman had been so impressed by his encounter with Yahweh&rsquo;s prophet Elisha, he decided to take two sackfuls of Israelite earth back to Aram (the city-state of Damascus) so that he could worship the god of Israel on appropriately holy ground. Fig. 8. The mysterious carved stone block from an affluent mid-first-century CE synagogue in the ancient city of Magdala, on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. It is decorated with religious symbols associated with the Jerusalem temple, including a large menorah, standing on a pedestal. There was nothing new about the idea that temple materials or sacred soil could be requisitioned and relocated for cultic service. In 689 BCE, the Assyrian king Sennacherib had destroyed the city of Babylon, but was keen to transfer the ancient prestige of Marduk&rsquo;s Babylonian akitu (New Year) temple to the akitu temple he was constructing in Ashur. Accordingly, he says, &lsquo;I removed dirt from Babylon and piled it in heaps and mounds in that akitu house&rsquo;. Harnessing the material power of sacred ground was one way to maintain the continuity of religious practice as the political ground shifted beneath the feet of gods and mortals. But another was to assert that the gods themselves could voluntarily abandon a temple without fear of undermining their presence in the world of their worshippers. This theological strategy would effect one of the biggest transformations in the social life of the God of the Bible. Lift Off Resting on their footstools, the feet of the gods had long embodied order, control and hierarchy in the universe. It was a power pose of cosmic supremacy. But divine footstools also played more nuanced, emotional roles in the body language of the gods. When the Late Bronze Age goddess Athirat pays a visit to her husband El, he is so delighted to see her that &lsquo;he unfurrowed his brow and laughed; he set his feet on the footstool, and wiggled his toes&rsquo;. His footstool is pressed into performative service again when he learns that Baal is dead, having been swallowed into the underworld by Mot, the god of death. El is distraught. He descends from his throne and sits on his footstool, and then lowers himself from his footstool to sit upon the ground to mourn. &lsquo;Baal is dead! What has become of the Powerful One?&rsquo; he cries. &lsquo;After Baal I shall go down into the underworld! &rsquo; 24 Coming down from his throne onto his footstool marks his ritual descent from the heavenly realm into the earthly world &ndash; the place of his feet &ndash; while his lowering from his footstool onto the ground enacts his descent from the earthly realm into the underworld. With the heavenly gods El and Baal out of place, the universe is catastrophically turned upside down, as Anat exclaims to Shapsh, the sun goddess: &lsquo;Dried up are the furrows of the fields, O Shapsh! Dried up are the furrows of El&rsquo;s fields, Baal is neglecting the furrows of the ploughland! Where is mighty Baal? Where is the Prince, master of the earth?&rsquo;25 Cosmic order is only restored when El foresees the return of Baal and his rains, and re-seats himself on the throne, pointedly setting his feet on his footstool once again. &lsquo;At last I can sit and rest&rsquo;, El declares, &lsquo;for alive is mighty Baal!&rsquo;26 In the Jerusalem temple, Yahweh&rsquo;s footstool also functioned as a ritual manifestation of the earthly realm upon which the deity set his feet. In some biblical texts, the divine footstool is an object so large that it subsumes both the temple and the city, rendering Jerusalem itself the giant footrest of the supersized god: &lsquo;Yahweh is huge in Zion!&rsquo; exclaims one psalmist urging pilgrims to Jerusalem: &lsquo;Worship at his footstool!&rsquo;27 It is a gigantism intensely magnified in the closing chapter of the book of Isaiah, in which God&rsquo;s temple furniture is presented as the very fabric of the cosmos itself: &lsquo;Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool! What is the house that you would build for me and what is my resting place?&rsquo; Yahweh bellows. Yahweh&rsquo;s assertion of corporeal gigantism and its follow-up question about the temple was as much a snipe at his critics as it was a boast of immense cosmic sovereignty. In 597 BCE, over a century before this particular oracle was proclaimed, the kingdom of Judah had been emphatically annexed by Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylonia, as he consolidated power across his newly won empire. And with vassalage came desecration. &lsquo;He carried off all the treasures of the house of Yahweh . . . he cut in pieces all the objects of gold in the temple of Yahweh, which King Solomon of Israel had made&rsquo;.God&rsquo;s golden throne and footstool were gone. Within a decade, Babylonian troops had returned, and this time, they sacked the city and destroyed the very fabric of the temple. In a painfully vivid lament, a ritual singer cries out to Yahweh: Lift up your feet because of the perpetual ruins, all that the enemy laid waste in the sanctuary. Your foes have roared within your holy place; they set up their emblems there. At the upper entrance they hacked the wooden trellis with axes. And then, with hatchets and hammers, they smashed all its carved work. They set your sanctuary on fire; they desecrated the dwelling place of your name, bringing it to the ground. Both the desecration and destruction of the Jerusalem temple threatened to shatter the mythological foundations underlying the claim that Yahweh&rsquo;s feet were set securely in Zion. The Hebrew Bible reflects the confusion arising from this disaster: some, like the lamenting poet, believed Yahweh had &lsquo;lifted up his feet&rsquo; to leave his sanctuary, now it had been defiled by the destructive presence of his enemies. Others assumed that the Babylonians had carried him off as a prisoner of war. Still others held he had permanently rejected Jerusalem because his priests had failed to attend sufficiently to his needs. However it was perceived, God&rsquo;s feet had wandered away. &lsquo;He has not remembered his footstool&rsquo;, wept the people of Jerusalem. Theological counterclaims quickly ensued. Among the urban elites exiled from Jerusalem to Babylonia in 597 BCE was a priest of Yahweh&rsquo;s temple, who saw visions of God as he longed for Jerusalem. The deity had been neither defeated nor repelled, Ezekiel claimed in the book bearing his name. Instead, he insisted, Yahweh had temporarily vacated his temple ahead of the foreign invasion he himself had planned, by wheeling himself out from his dwelling place on what was now his mobile throne. Ezekiel had seen it all, he said: the two cherubim flanking God&rsquo;s throne and footstool had become four, matching the compass of the world, and each of them now perched atop a wheel. As the cherubim lifted their wings and elevated the throne, the wheels turned, and Yahweh rolled out of his temple &ndash; without lifting his feet or leaving his seat. This highly specialized, esoteric image of the enthroned deity would become a stock feature of later Jewish mysticism, entrancing ancient scholars and visionaries alike. But the wheeled throne was not a notion Ezekiel had desperately plucked from the sky &ndash; despite having seen it, he said, when the clouds of heavens had rolled open to reveal their secrets to him. The augmentations customizing Yahweh&rsquo;s cherubim throne were drawn from much older mythologies. Deities across ancient south-west Asia had long employed the services of their attribute animals and attendant monsters to get them about. Some stood on the back of a lion, like the great goddesses Ishtar and Athirat, while others stationed themselves on the back of a bull, like Adad and Baal. Some ceremonially stood on a monstrous snake-headed or lion-bodied dragon, like Marduk of Babylon and Ashur of Assyria (fig. 9), while others stood or sat enthroned upon a cherub &ndash; just like Yahweh. Upon their fantastic pedestals, the gods could travel about the heavens, parade about their cities, or settle themselves in exalted glory in their temples. As a powerful storm god, Yahweh had long been known to travel on a cherub, splitting open the skies on clouds heavy with rain, and crashing into the earthly realm with a thunderous shout: He bent the heavens and came down, and a thick cloud was beneath his feet. He rode on a cherub, and flew, and came swiftly upon the wings of the wind. He made darkness his covering around him, his canopy thick clouds dark with water. Out of the brightness before him, there broke through his clouds hailstones and coals of fire. Yahweh thundered in the heavens, the Most High uttered his voice.4 The storm clouds enveloping Yahweh&rsquo;s cherubic mount were an especially celebrated feature of his divine vigour, and were already imagined as a sky chariot. &lsquo;Sing to God, sing praises to his name!&rsquo; worshippers sang in the Jerusalem temple. &lsquo;Lift up the charioteer of the clouds! Yah is his name, therefore exalt before him!&rsquo;35 Yahweh appears to have inherited his role and title as the &lsquo;charioteer of the clouds&rsquo; from the storm god Baal, whose skill at charging about the heavens was particularly lauded at Ugarit. Combining the throne-and-footstool iconography of the Jerusalem temple with the ancient motif of the cherub-riding cloud-charioteer, Ezekiel&rsquo;s god was a deity of cosmic dynamism. Yahweh had left the temple, but he had not been toppled from his throne, and nor had he abandoned it. The high god of Jerusalem remained seated in glory, his feet firmly fixed on his footstool, as he wheeled out of his city to join his exiles in Babylonia: &lsquo;Though I removed them far away among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary to them&rsquo;, he declared.6 This was a deity unconstrained by traditional territorial boundaries and undefeated by the devastation of desecration. On his mobile throne, he brought the sacred space of Jerusalem to his dispossessed worshippers. Fig. 9. A large gypsum wall plaque from a residential building in the Assyrian city of Ashur, dated to the seventh century BCE. It shows a majestic, bearded deity, likely Ashur himself, standing on the back of a winged, horned lion. The deity holds his right hand aloft in a gesture of blessing. A century or so later, the writer of what is now the final chapter of Isaiah thus adopted a similar strategy to downplay the destruction of the Jerusalem temple. Like Ezekiel, this prophet adapted much older mythological themes to insist that Yahweh remained enthroned, his feet reassuringly planted in the world of his worshippers &ndash; no matter where they were. But there was no need for sky chariots and cherubim to illustrate Yahweh&rsquo;s international reach, and no need for a man-made temple to prove his presence. Instead, the gigantism of God proved the deity remained seated in glory. &lsquo;Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool!&rsquo; Yahweh emphatically declared.7 Although his temple in Jerusalem lay in ruins, Yahweh&rsquo;s cosmic supremacy was undiminished, and his feet were still firmly fixed in the earthly realm. The Jerusalem temple would be rebuilt in the early fifth century BCE, and permanently destroyed by Titus in 70 CE. But the idea that God sat enthroned in the heavens, with his feet resting on the earth, remained irresistibly potent to many early Jewish and Christian writers. Some pressed God&rsquo;s boast in Isaiah into polemical service against the material trappings of temple cults. Others, however, understood the text more literally, and cast the earth itself as the divine footstool of God, later prompting some rabbis and (according to Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel) Jesus of Nazareth to forbid their followers from &lsquo;blasphemously&rsquo; invoking the earth in swearing ritual oaths.8 But several Jewish and Christian communities clearly embraced the divine corporeality presented in Isaiah, and quite reasonably assumed that God&rsquo;s body was so gigantic it reached from earth to heaven. It was a scripturally endorsed belief that would become increasingly problematic &ndash; particularly for early Christian thinkers, who preferred the divine body to take the form of Christ, rather than that of a supersized deity more akin to the &lsquo;pagan&rsquo; deities of Rome. In the Graeco-Roman world, a certain philosophical distaste for the earthiness of the material world, combined with an increasing spiritual preference for the abstract and the transcendent, had been percolating among the intelligentsia for some time, encouraging a re-evaluation of the nature of the divine. It was against this backdrop that the architects of early Christian doctrine sought to understand their own scriptures, in which God was often presented in disturbingly corporeal terms. In their intellectual world, Christ was the only incarnation of God. Those troublesome verses in the scriptures attesting to God&rsquo;s body would be smoothed, smothered, or superseded by new interpretative frameworks and some fancy philosophical footwork. A favourite tactic employed by early Christian theologians was simply to reduce all biblical references to God&rsquo;s body to the symbolic. When the scriptures instructed people to worship at God&rsquo;s footstool, it was towards the cross to which Christ&rsquo;s feet were nailed that worshippers were directed. Another strategy, of course, was simply to insist that biblical references to God&rsquo;s body parts were metaphorical and allegorical, and were not to be taken literally. &lsquo;Reverence rather requires . . . an allegorical meaning&rsquo;, wrote Clement of Alexandria (c. 150&ndash;215 CE). &lsquo;You must not entertain the notion at all of figure and motion, or standing or seating, or place, or right or left, as appertaining to the Father of the universe, although these terms are in Scripture&rsquo;. Instead, Clement argued, the biblical ascription of body parts to God was a divinely directed accommodation to the limitations of human understanding.9 Some early Christian theologians navigated the disorientating portrayals of God&rsquo;s feet by bending and stretching the temporal dimensions in which God was understood to walk in the world: when Adam and Eve had heard God walking in the garden, it was actually the sound of Christ as the pre-existent, spoken Word of God moving towards them. The extent to which these theological manoeuvres were practised by ordinary Christians is a matter of considerable debate among scholars. What is more certain, however, is that, by the third century CE, the Christian exegete and theologian Origen was so appalled by those who still conceived of God as a cosmic giant that he launched a scathing attack upon them in one of his famous homilies: &lsquo;Those carnal men who have no understanding of the meaning of divinity suppose . . . that God has so large a body that they think he sits in heaven and stretches his feet to the earth.&rsquo; Rather, he argued, God could not possibly be corporeal. Influenced by his conviction that scripture often revealed its truths on ascending levels of spiritual insight (primarily the literal, the moral and the allegorical), Origen contended that the portrayal of God&rsquo;s body in Isaiah was figurative in form and allegorical in nature. It served, he claimed, to illustrate the spiritual gulf between those &lsquo;at the most remote part&rsquo; of God&rsquo;s providence, who were too caught up in the literal, worldly affairs of the created realm, and those at the head end of the Creator God, who sought to acquire a heavenly &lsquo;perfection of life and loftiness of understanding&rsquo; as true Christians. It was a convoluted, theological abstraction that would influence Christian interpretation of this biblical text and others like it for centuries to come, reflecting an increasingly powerful conceptual shift away from an old-fashioned mythological imagination to a world in which the symbolic and the abstract were granted the highest cultural and theological status. But in rendering the realm of creation in which humans dwelt so estranged from God, Origen and those Church Fathers to follow in his footsteps would contribute to the ongoing theological distancing of the divine from the earthly world of human experience. In doing so, they widened the emerging fissure between the corporeal and the spiritual &ndash; and in effect, dislodged God&rsquo;s enormous feet from the Christian world. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.n5jyhmdxs4je"><span class="c4">Chaper 4</span></h1><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">SENSATIONAL FEET Despite the blisters and bunions so often wrought by modern footwear, it remains all too easy to overlook the significance of our feet as sophisticated sensory organs &ndash; parts of our bodies we can use to feel, grasp and keep &lsquo;in touch&rsquo; with the world. But our ancestors used their feet far more frequently to &lsquo;think&rsquo; with &ndash; to understand and manipulate the world in which they walked and worked. Whether threshing and milling grains and seeds, treading fruit, herding animals, rolling manure for firebricks and fertilizer, turning the potter&rsquo;s wheel, weaving textiles and baskets, or measuring distance and time, the world was experienced through people&rsquo;s feet in ways increasingly unfamiliar in the modern age. Our ancestors were far more focused on their feet &ndash; literally more grounded &ndash; than most of us are today, and this naturally shaped their body practices and religious imaginations. In the cultures of ancient south-west Asia, the feet were particularly precious sensory organs and had to be looked after. Happy feet were those that were washed and (for the wealthy) oiled several times a day to help prevent swelling, blistering and skin cracking (fig. 10). A good pair of sandals that rarely needed patching was a prized commodity. Travellers petitioned the gods for wide, stable surfaces to walk upon, instead of the slip and scrape of unstable ground; they requested divine protection from thorns, stones, snake bites and shoes that pinch. Curse texts and malevolent incantations often targeted the feet of their victims &ndash; shoelessness, skin diseases, hobbling, lameness and toe amputation were particularly popular. In some biblical texts, as in other ancient legislative literature, retaliatory punishment or compensation for criminal offences demanded not only &lsquo;a life for a life&rsquo; and &lsquo;an eye for an eye&rsquo;, but &lsquo;a foot for a foot&rsquo;. Fig. 10. A late eighth-century BCE basin from a gatehouse in the Judahite city of Lachish, assumed to be a foot bath. The ledges inside these objects are thought to have supported the foot while it was being washed, oiled and dried. Within this world, the feet of the gods were as tactile and as sensory as those of their worshippers. Just as human bodies experienced the visceral carnage of warfare, the dry rustle of the threshing floor, or the squelch of the wine press, so too did the bodies of the gods. Mythic texts abound with detailed descriptions of their intense sensory experiences, some of which border on the monstrous. When she goes on the rampage against humans, the fearsome warrior goddess Anat is &lsquo;up to her knees [as] she wades in the blood of soldiers, up to her neck in the gore of fighters&rsquo;. It is a sensation she enjoys so much that when she returns home, she transforms the chairs and tables in her dining hall into an army of living victims, fresh for trampling. Not one to be outdone by his older Ugaritic cousin, the God of the Bible also showcases his martial expertise by excessive body-trampling. In a particularly graphic scene in Isaiah, the deity recasts the horror of the battlefield as the joy of the village harvest: a lookout in Jerusalem sees Yahweh marching back towards the city from an attack on the enemy kingdom of Edom, his clothing blotched with crimson stains. &lsquo;Why are your robes red, and your garments like theirs who tread the wine press?&rsquo; asks the sentry. &lsquo;I have trodden the wine press&rsquo;, Yahweh declares; &lsquo;I trod them in my anger and trampled them in my wrath; their juice spattered on my garments, and stained all my robes&rsquo;. Keen to ensure his metaphor has not been misunderstood, the deity spells it out: &lsquo;I trampled down peoples in my anger, I crushed them in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth&rsquo;. This is a god who has felt the crunch of bones and skulls under his feet; the warm, wet mulch of human flesh around his ankles; the hot spray of blood on his legs. It is an ancient vision of divine bloodlust heartily embraced by successive generations of his worshippers &ndash; including the writer of the New Testament book of Revelation. In this esoteric, fantastical work depicting the cosmic battles that will bring about the world to come, the apocalypse is a bloody day of reckoning: God uses an enormous wine press outside Jerusalem to kill his earthly enemies. Humans are harvested with a sickle, like grapes from the vine, and thrown into God&rsquo;s wine vat; the flood of blood gushing from the press rises as high as a horse&rsquo;s bridle, soaking an area of 1,600 stadia &ndash; a vast distance of about 200 miles. The bloodied robes of the divine vintner are transferred to Christ, who is clothed in them when he appears from the heavens upon a white warhorse, ready for the final battle for Jerusalem, when he too will tread the divine wine press. His white linen robes, stained with scarlet smears of blood, would be evoked by the pale tunics decorated with blood-red crosses worn by medieval Europe&rsquo;s Christian armies in their Crusades against the &lsquo;ungodly&rsquo; of the Holy Land. But if we should expect to find traces of blood between God&rsquo;s toes and around his legs, so too we would find on his feet the dewy residues of his calmer moments. Many deities were known to enjoy walking, whether in their gardens, their temples, or around their cities. In Genesis, Yahweh is said to walk regularly in his Garden of Eden &lsquo;at the time of the evening breeze&rsquo; &ndash; a fleeting but evocative detail conjuring the impression of a deity enjoying a stroll at the end of the day, his feet cooling as they brush through lush vegetation. Outside the garden, however, walking could be hazardous, and Yahweh was at risk of stepping in something unpleasant if he didn&rsquo;t take the necessary precautions. It is for this reason that he issues the Israelites travelling from Egypt to the Promised Land with special instructions for defecation: &lsquo;You shall have a designated area outside the camp to which you shall go; with your utensils you shall have a trowel; when you relieve yourself outside, you shall dig a hole with it and then cover up your excrement, because Yahweh your god walks in your camp.&rsquo;7 Walking might also come with added benefits. In a world in which mobility offered additional opportunities for socializing, travel was often associated with the forging of new familial and economic relationships &ndash; in particular, it was a chance for men to acquire brides and for fathers to marry off their daughters. The mythologies of this world suggest that the gods might similarly have encountered new lovers as they walked about. In a Sumerian myth, the high deity Enlil is out for a stroll along a riverbank when he meets the goddess Ninlil, resulting in the two having repeated and rampant sex. Similarly, at Ugarit, El&rsquo;s bracing walk along the seashore leads to a highly erotic sexual encounter with two young goddesses, who consequently bear him divine children. For Yahweh, however, walking was stimulating in other ways: it was an opportunity for amiable, male companionship. Enoch, Noah and Abraham are all said to have walked with God &ndash; an activity more usually undertaken by minor deities such as Resheph and Deber, terrifying purveyors of plague and pestilence, who march alongside him in his marauding army. But when humans walk with Yahweh, their close physical proximity to the deity marks their likeness to the divine &ndash; they are &lsquo;blameless&rsquo; (or righteous) in the world and blemish-free in body, and hence set apart (made &lsquo;holy&rsquo;) for Yahweh&rsquo;s exclusive attention and company. Scholars usually interpret this as an elaborate theological metaphor, so that in the Bible, to walk with God is to fall into religious step with him &ndash; a notion echoed in the Arabic term shari&lsquo;a (&lsquo;path&rsquo; or &lsquo;way&rsquo;), which is used to describe the function of Islamic law as a guide to divine will. But on occasion, the biblical writers seem to have understood walking with God as a more corporeal activity: Abraham is portrayed as literally walking and talking with Yahweh and two of his divine colleagues on the road from Mamre towards Sodom. And Yahweh enjoys Enoch&rsquo;s company so much that even after 300 years of walking the earth together, the deity decides to lift him into the heavenly realm, where in a rich collection of early Jewish and Christian literature, Enoch continues to travel about heaven&rsquo;s various dimensions, meeting its angelic inhabitants. For Yahweh, walking in step with his worshippers was a form of male bonding &ndash; and shaped the very essence of his special relationship with the Israelites, who are consistently gendered as the &lsquo;sons&rsquo; of Jacob [Israel]: &lsquo;I will walk among you, and will be God to you, and you, you will be my people&rsquo;. It may be that companionship was Yahweh&rsquo;s goal when he went for his evening stroll in the Garden of Eden, for as he walks, he is on the lookout for Adam. But Adam is nowhere to be seen. &lsquo;Where are you?&rsquo; he calls out, like the frustrated loser in a game of hide-and-seek (and laying to rest any idea that the God of the Bible is omniscient and omnipotent). A near-naked Adam emerges from the foliage and shyly confesses to Yahweh that he could &lsquo;hear the sound&rsquo; of him walking, and so had time to conceal his newly realized nudity among the trees. God&rsquo;s feet may have been sensuously receptive to the pleasures of the garden, but they were also very noisy. Noisy feet were not usually a problem for the gods. Rather, the sonorous impact of divine footfall was a certain indication to humans in the earthly realm of the ongoing activity of their deities. The loud, heavy marching of the gods caused the earth to tremble and the mountains to quake, just as they did when Yahweh processed in imperial victory from his wilderness home to take possession of the land of Canaan. &lsquo;O Yahweh, when you went out from Seir, when you marched from the steppe of Edom, the earth trembled!&rsquo; his worshippers gleefully sang; &lsquo;the mountains quaked before Yahweh, he of Sinai, before Yahweh, the god of Israel!&rsquo;14 The noise of the gods&rsquo; footsteps might also function as a siren in the earthly realm, triggering holy war between nations and their deities. In the books of Samuel, an oracle instructs King David to listen out for the sound of the wind in a grove of trees before launching an attack on the Philistines: &lsquo;when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then be on the alert; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike down the army&rsquo;. Along with marching, foot-pounding was also particularly popular with warrior deities, and typical of the gods at Ugarit, who frequently punctuated their arguments and declarations of war with ferocious stamping. It was a clear signal of divine rage, as the good-looking hero Aqhat discovered when he refused to give his magical bow and arrows to the goddess Anat: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make you fall under my feet, pretty-boy, he-man&rsquo;, she threatens, stamping her feet so hard that &lsquo;the earth shook&rsquo;. This ancient idea survived well into later periods, so that even in rabbinic literature, earth tremors were sometimes thought to be caused by God pounding his feet in fury or vengeance. The gods are not often described as having quiet feet &ndash; as divine beings, they rarely felt the need to move by stealth. But if they did, they might remove their shoes, so as to muffle the sound of their footsteps, particularly when they risked journeying into the underworld. Pitched as a place of dimmed light and hushed noise, the requirement that visitors to the underworld remove their sturdy travelling shoes not only warned that they might not be able to return home, but lessened the disruptive imposition of their presence. The removal of footwear mattered far more to the gods in other ways: their worshippers were often expected to take off their shoes before praying or stepping inside a place of worship &ndash; an ancient custom inherited by Islam, and required of anyone entering a mosque today. Although this practice is shared with other religious groups (including Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists), in Islam it arguably derives in part from much older religious preferences, attested in some societies across ancient south-west Asia and the eastern Mediterranean, in which barefootedness played an important sensory role for both humans and gods. The art and inscriptions of ancient Egypt suggest that barefootedness was a common ritual prerequisite to entering a temple. This was sacred space &ndash; the place of the feet of the gods &ndash; and so the feet of priests and worshippers were to be unshod and washed before they could tread where the gods stepped. As a further precaution, a ritual known as the &lsquo;Bringing of the Foot&rsquo; was undertaken by priests and other cult functionaries, who used a magical broom to sweep the floor as they backed away from the altar, removing human footprints from the sanctuary. Ritual foot-washing and floor-and-wall cleansing was practised across Mesopotamia, too, where the appropriate management of disruptive &lsquo;dirt&rsquo; inside sacred space demanded not cleaners, but exorcists, skilled in the safe manipulation and eradication of otherworldly dust. It is against this wider cultural backdrop that certain ritual forms of shoeremoval and foot-washing in the biblical world are best understood. Barefootedness appears to have been the norm for priests in Yahweh&rsquo;s temples, for references to footwear are conspicuously absent in biblical and early Jewish descriptions of priestly vestments, while certain ritual prescriptions attest to the daubing of blood or water on the bare feet and toes of the priests once they moved inside Yahweh&rsquo;s sanctuaries. By the Roman period, most Jewish communities across Palestine were engaging in regular ritual foot-washing. The jugs, troughs and small clay foot basins of older centuries were gradually supplemented or replaced at sacred sites and synagogues with a specially constructed bathing pool called a mikveh. This stepped stone structure allowed groups of worshippers to cleanse not only their feet, but their whole bodies, accommodating the communal waterimmersion practices popular with groups as diverse as Jerusalem-based Torah scholars, the Dead Sea Scrolls community, and the followers of holy men like John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth (fig. 11). By this time, the priestly prerogative to go barefoot when worshipping Yahweh already appears to have been extended to all those who might step onto Jerusalem&rsquo;s Temple Mount. It was far from sufficient simply to remove sandals &ndash; all feet had to be ritually cleansed before they could come into contact with holy ground. To ascend the Temple Mount to God&rsquo;s dwelling place was to enter into the heavens, and as the Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria put it, &lsquo;the washing of feet . . . means that we should no longer walk on the earth, but sweep through the heights of the ether&rsquo;. Writing in the first century CE, shortly before the destruction of the temple, Philo claimed that even the hooves of sacrificial animals were washed before they stepped into the temple precinct &ndash; after all, &lsquo;according to the saying, one should not enter with unwashed feet on the pavement of the temple of God&rsquo;. It was an ancient religious requirement that had been famously flouted in 167 BCE by the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes when he looted the Jerusalem temple to fund his military campaigns. This shocking event triggered painful cultural memories of the Babylonian desecration of the temple in the sixth century BCE, moving a Jewish poet to pen a bitter lament, berating the foreigners who &lsquo;arrogantly trampled&rsquo; the sanctuary of God &lsquo;with their sandals&rsquo;.5 Fig. 11. A purpose-built mikveh at ancient Gamlah, a town in the Upper Galilee. Likely constructed early in the first century CE, it was destroyed in 67 CE, when Gamlah was attacked during the Roman campaign to crush Jewish uprisings against imperial rule. It was one thing for &lsquo;outsiders&rsquo; to trample the temple, but quite another for Yahweh&rsquo;s own worshippers to defile the place of his feet in Jerusalem. In the highly volatile context of the Graeco-Roman era, in which religious control of the city was repeatedly sought and contested by both establishment and sectarian Jewish groups, accusations of temple defilement were common. Writing in the first century CE, the Jewish historian Josephus deploys this rhetorical weapon against the Zealots, whom he claims entered the sanctuary &lsquo;with polluted feet&rsquo;. More sensationally, this is precisely what Jesus is also said to have done. A fragmentary papyrus manuscript found amid a cache of documents in an ancient rubbish tip at the Egyptian site of Oxyrhynchus preserves an otherwise unattested story about Jesus and his disciples. Dating from the first half of the second century CE, the text describes Jesus and his disciples wandering about the Jerusalem temple, and the shocked response of a high priest who discovers them there: &lsquo;Who gave you permission to walk in this place of purification and look upon these holy vessels when you have not bathed and your disciples have not washed their feet?&rsquo; the priest demands. Jesus answers back with a vicious denunciation of Jewish purification rites, insultingly belittling their function and the high priest himself: &lsquo;You have washed in this running water, in which dogs and pigs have wallowed night and day, and you have washed and scrubbed your outer skin, which harlots and flute-girls also anoint and wash and scrub, beautifying themselves for the lusts of men while inwardly they are filled with scorpions and unrighteousness of every kind.&rsquo;27 While this story is not out of keeping with the Gospels&rsquo; portrayal of a frequently confrontational and hostile Jesus, its sharp anti-Jewish polemic suggests it is probably a later invention, reflecting disputes among Jewish&ndash; Christian communities of the second century CE about the relative value of traditional purity rituals vis-&agrave;-vis Christian baptism. Nevertheless, it is a good illustration of the continued perception that &lsquo;unclean&rsquo; feet were not to tread on the temple&rsquo;s holy ground. After the religiously cataclysmic destruction of the Jerusalem temple by the Roman general Titus in 70 CE, the removal of shoes was a ritual transferred from temple priests to rabbis officiating in synagogues across ancient Palestine. While the Babylonian Talmud suggests it was not a practice necessarily expected in the synagogues of ancient diaspora communities, it was popular among some groups. And it is a tradition in the worship of the Jewish God that has survived in part today: while barefootedness in synagogues is not required, in Orthodox services males of priestly descent (kohanim) will remove their shoes when proclaiming the priestly benediction. In the ancient world, all these activities reflected the notion that shoes were symbols of power. To wear them inside a temple was to assert a social dominance entirely inappropriate in the presence of the gods &ndash; a view that would encourage a social preference among ancient pilgrims across the eastern Mediterranean to travel in barefooted humility. But bare feet were also quiet feet. High-ranking gods &ndash; especially those among the oldest generations &ndash; enjoyed periods of peace and quiet as much as the rest of us, and might easily be provoked to anger should the smack and slap of noisy sandals in their temples become too loud. Indeed, humans had long been known as inherently noisy creatures. In the Mesopotamian epic Atrahasis, dated to about 1700 BCE, the high god Enlil famously decides to kill off humans with a great flood because, he says, &lsquo;the noise of mankind has become too much; I&rsquo;m losing sleep over their racket&rsquo;. It is an episode which speaks to a divine distaste for excessive human noise, well attested for millennia across ancient south-west Asia and the eastern Mediterranean. The truly pious were often characterized as those who conducted themselves quietly in temples: in an Egyptian text of the Eighteenth Dynasty (c. 1550&ndash;1305 BCE), the god Amun was quite understandably said to love &lsquo;the silent one more than the one with a loud voice&rsquo;. In Greece, several centuries later, even Socrates, denounced by his opponents for not &lsquo;believing&rsquo; in the gods of the Athenian state, was teasingly demanding silence from his debating partner, &lsquo;for there seems to be a divine presence in this spot&rsquo;. The God of the Bible similarly preferred limited words and muffled feet. In the book of Ecclesiastes (known in Jewish tradition as Qoheleth), worshippers are advised to &lsquo;guard your steps when you go to the house of God . . . let your words be few&rsquo;. Shoeless feet were quiet feet, and quiet feet were the feet of the devout. It was not only a divine aversion to human noisiness that encouraged shoelessness among worshippers. As many of these foot-focused traditions and rituals reveal, barefootedness also expressed concerns across the ancient world about ritual purity: the dust, dirt and decay of the &lsquo;ordinary&rsquo; world outside a temple could not be allowed to pollute the purity or &lsquo;cleanness&rsquo; of the ground inside the temple. Ritual washing before (and sometimes after) entering sacred space enabled priests and worshippers to maintain an embodied distinction between the sacred and profane, and so guard against the dangerous wrath of the gods, who might punish transgressors with death, or &ndash; worse &ndash; reject the whole community by abandoning their dwelling places. In Roman-era Judah, the bodily dynamics of traditional worship would render human feet overtly political. Although he is more usually remembered as a baby-killer, King Herod&rsquo;s legacy is more reliably represented by his impressive building projects, many of which were designed to enrich (quite literally) holy sites across his realm. Most significant was his large-scale renovation of the Jerusalem temple, which expanded its outer courtyards to accommodate ever larger numbers of pilgrims and &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; visitors during festivals. But by the time his ambitious plans had come to fruition, in about 64 CE (nearly seventy years after his death), non-Jewish people were strictly prohibited from setting foot inside the temple&rsquo;s precincts. Bodily purity was a ritual state of such importance that allowing anybody other than Yahweh&rsquo;s own worshippers to approach the deity&rsquo;s dwelling place risked unclean feet trampling dangerous ritual pollutants across holy ground. According to Josephus, the stone balustrade surrounding the temple&rsquo;s precincts carried inscriptions &lsquo;giving warning, some in Greek, others in Latin characters, of the law of purification, to wit that no foreigner was allowed to enter the holy place&rsquo;. Some of these inscriptions have been found, the most complete of which is now in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum. Written in Greek, it reads, &lsquo;No foreigner is to enter within the balustrade and forecourt around the sacred precinct. Whoever is caught will himself be responsible for [his] consequent death&rsquo; (fig. 12).3 Over time, anxieties about ritual impurities carried by the feet would morph into a fuzzier cultural understanding within many societies that the shoes and feet of humans were potentially antisocial because of their intense, frequent contact with the ground beyond the bounds of sacred space. Accordingly, feet and shoes are today carefully managed outside as well as inside places of worship in a number of communities. As is well known, it is now customary to remove shoes upon entering a Muslim home. In Orthodox Jewish communities, shoes are not to be worn indoors during periods of mourning, nor on Yom Kippur, when even among liberal Jewish groups, the &lsquo;decaying&rsquo; materials of leather shoes are often to be swapped in favour of bare feet or synthetic fabrics. In some eastern Mediterranean and Middle Eastern societies, it is often inappropriate to show the soles of the feet, and the bottoms of shoes must not come into contact with other parts of the body &ndash; a cultural concern powerfully harnessed on screens around the world in 2008, when Iraqi journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi protested against the Iraq War by throwing his &lsquo;polluting&rsquo; shoes at US President George W. Bush during a press conference. Fig. 12. &lsquo;No foreigner is to enter within the balustrade and forecourt around the sacred precinct&rsquo;, begins this first-century CE Greek inscription on a marble slab. It was originally set into the barrier separating the large outer court on Jerusalem&rsquo;s Temple Mount from the inner precinct surrounding the temple building. But just as purity regulations in the ancient world safeguarded divine presence in temples and sanctuaries, so too they protected human communities in their own spaces. Shoe removal at a temple prevented the holiness of sacred ground being tracked unchecked out of the temple and into the streets of the ordinary world. The &lsquo;extraordinary&rsquo; ground of temples contained something of the material properties of divine presence, transmitted from the feet of the gods, which demanded careful handling. Just as a spell-caster might use soil taken from a footprint or dust wiped from the feet of a man to cause him harm, so too the dust from the temple floor on which the gods walked might be used in magical incantations. And the biblical writers were well aware of this. In one of the more unsettling religious laws in the book of Numbers, compiled in about the fifth century BCE, any woman accused of adultery is to be brought into Yahweh&rsquo;s sanctuary, to stand before the priest and the deity. The priest mixes some dust from the floor of the sanctuary into a vessel containing holy water, into which has been dissolved the ink from a written curse. &lsquo;May this water that brings the curse enter your bowels and make your womb discharge, your uterus drop!&rsquo; incants the priest. The woman drinks the potion. If she suffers a miscarriage, she is guilty of adultery, and will be estranged from the community. If she suffers no ill effects, she is innocent, and any child she subsequently bears will be recognized as that of her husband.5 It is the numinous power of sacred space, materialized in its very earth and stone, that ultimately underlies ancient religious preferences for shoe removal. Barefootedness enabled the worshipper to come safely but intimately into direct physical contact with the divine. And it is this feet first approach to the gods which underlies one of the most famous stories of barefooted holy men in Western culture: that of Moses and the burning bush in the book of Exodus. The story is set in the wilderness on Mount Horeb (an alternative name for Sinai), and describes Moses&rsquo; first encounter with Yahweh. Moses is tending his father-in-law&rsquo;s flock of goats when he comes upon a thornbush that is mysteriously engulfed but undamaged by flames. As he pauses, intending to take a closer look, God calls out to him from within the bush: &lsquo;Come no closer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place [maqom] on which you are standing is holy ground!&rsquo; Obeying the deity&rsquo;s instructions, Moses approaches the god in the bush. The two have a lengthy conversation, but Moses is compelled to cover his face &lsquo;because he was afraid to look at God&rsquo;. Temporarily blinded, Moses&rsquo; encounter with the deity is sustained not by sight, but by bare feet &ndash; feet that feel the sacred ground in which the bush itself is rooted.7 In the southern Sinai, a towering bramble enshrined within a sunny courtyard in the Monastery of the God-Trodden Mount is traditionally identified as the very place where Moses first met Yahweh. Nestled in a rocky gorge at the foot of the holy mountain, the monastery itself is better known as St Catherine&rsquo;s, and was formally founded by the Eastern Roman emperor Justinian in the sixth century CE. It is home to some of the oldest religious art of the Byzantine world, including the stunning golden mosaics that shimmer on the apse and triumphal arch in the Justinian basilica. Here, there are two dazzling images of a po-faced Moses on the holy mountain: one shows him as a rugged young man, taking off his sandals before a bright green bush alive with dancing red flames (Plate 5); the other shows him as an aging, exhausted elder, standing barefoot on Sinai&rsquo;s peak as God&rsquo;s hand plunges out of the sky to give him the Ten Commandments. In both mosaics, Moses continues to model good practice for his monastic audience, for abutting the external wall of the apse is the older fourth century Chapel of the Burning Bush, next to which the revered bush grows. Today, the monks of St Catherine&rsquo;s are still required to remove their shoes before stepping inside to pray before its holy of holies, said to be located directly above the roots of the sacred bush. Shoe removal at the Chapel of the Burning Bush is just one of a number of barefooted rituals to survive into the monotheisms of the modern era. Whether Jewish, Christian, or Muslim, and whether habitual or episodic, shoe removal and barefootedness remains a powerful sensory experience in the religious lives of millions of worshippers today, echoing very ancient encounters with sacred ground. Foot Fetish Shortly after his election to papal office in 2013, Pope Francis appalled conservative Roman Catholics across the world by bathing, drying and kissing the feet of two women during the foot-washing ceremony of Easter week. Closely aligned to the Last Supper narrative in the Gospel of John, in which Jesus is portrayed as washing his disciples&rsquo; feet, the Roman Catholic ritual traditionally restricted recipients of the practice to selected male members of the congregation (a convention only enshrined in Holy Week liturgy in 1956). Many critics voiced their discomfort at the Pope&rsquo;s breaching of Church law, protesting that the maleness of the disciples should be faithfully represented by male participants in the rite &ndash; the same objection long levelled against those in favour of the ordination of women to the priesthood. But the Pope persisted, and has washed and kissed the feet of women (and those of non-Christians) every Easter since, supporting his actions with a papal decree in 2016 and advising that, where possible, women should be included in the ceremony. Protestors continued to object. Some insisted it is the authoritative status of Church law, and not institutionalized gender inequality, that necessitates the exclusion of women from the ritual. &lsquo;Foot washing is too important to be dragged into a feminist debate&rsquo;, asserted the headline in one Roman Catholic newspaper. Others, however, appeared to be more unsettled by the Pope and his priests performing such an intimate body-ritual with women. From the underbelly of liturgical conservatism re-emerged a deeply rooted misogynistic anxiety about the &lsquo;dangerous&rsquo; sexuality of women &ndash; and their feet. In Kazakhstan, for example, Bishop Athanasius Schneider of Astana (now Nur-Sultan) responded to the papal decree by publicly declaring the washing and kissing of women&rsquo;s feet &lsquo;improper and even indecent&rsquo;, while in the UK, the Latin Mass Society of England and Wales published a statement expressing concerns about &lsquo;the etiquette of men washing the feet of women&rsquo;, as an activity that &lsquo;would have been considered inappropriate only a few decades ago in the West&rsquo;. To bathe and kiss the feet of another is an act of intense intimacy &ndash; embarrassingly so for some Christians, as modern religious commentators have often noted. Consequently, Church theologians are often keen to emphasize the ancient heritage of the ritual in mitigating any discomfort around its intimacy. In the hierarchical societies of first-century CE Roman Palestine, they point out, foot-washing was one of the duties of a servant or slave, whose own body was merely a tool for the servicing of that of his or her overlord. As such, when Jesus washes his disciples&rsquo; feet at the Last Supper in the Gospel of John, it is to be read as an act of servile humility, enacting the deliberate self-abasement of the &lsquo;master&rsquo; (Jesus) to his &lsquo;servants&rsquo; (the disciples). But in the highly loaded imagery of the Gospel, Jesus&rsquo; actions also carry a far weightier religious freight &ndash; and they are not quite as humble as they might appear. This is a Gospel in which Jesus&rsquo; actions move beyond the symbolic to serve instead as carefully coded, revelatory performances which point insistently to his divinity. &lsquo;You do not know what I am doing, but later you will understand&rsquo;, Jesus says as he crouches at Peter&rsquo;s feet, who is utterly confused by the proceedings, and protesting loudly: &lsquo;You will never wash my feet!&rsquo; he declares. Realizing he has to make things clearer, Jesus tells the disciples he is making their feet ritually &lsquo;clean&rsquo; &ndash; in other words, physically ready to enter into the presence of the divine, in keeping with the conventions of Jewish temple practice. &lsquo;Unless I wash you, you have no share with me&rsquo;, he says, warning his followers that they will lose their place alongside him if their feet are not ritually pure &ndash; and thereby claiming that he himself is the grounded locus of divine presence among his disciples. This is a divine presence repeatedly manifested by Jesus&rsquo; feet in early Christian literature. Although first-century CE rabbis were accustomed to their students and followers sitting at their feet, the biblical portrayal of Jesus&rsquo; feet often elevates his status beyond that of a religious teacher and casts him instead as a divine figure. Like the ancient gods before him, Jesus tramples the chaotic waters of the raging sea into quiet submission. When the sick and infirm are placed at his feet, they are healed by his life-giving powers. In the Gospels, followers frequently fall at Jesus&rsquo; feet, where some are explicitly said to worship him. It is an action often accompanied by his devotees clutching or kissing his feet, much as gods and their cult statues were grasped and kissed on the feet in myths and rituals throughout ancient south-west Asia and the eastern Mediterranean. In Hebrew Bible texts, on which the earliest Christians drew to support their claims about Jesus&rsquo; divinity, it is an act of ritual veneration performed in honour of gods and divinely anointed kings. Indeed, in Psalm 2, one of the most important scriptural passages used by early Christians to support their claims that Jesus was the son of God and royal Messiah (in Greek, Christos), worshippers are pointedly instructed to kiss the divine feet. The veneration of Jesus&rsquo; feet is most explicitly expressed in the story in Luke&rsquo;s Gospel about a woman who seeks out Jesus while he is dining at the house of a Pharisee &ndash; a member of a conservative group of Torah specialists. Described as a &lsquo;sinner&rsquo; and given no name (although often assumed to be Mary Magdalene), she positions herself at Jesus&rsquo; feet as he reclines at the table, weeping so much that she floods tears upon them. She bathes his feet with her tears and rubs them dry with her unbound hair &ndash; a style more usually seen publicly on women venerating the gods in a sanctuary or performing mourning rituals. Her flood of tears becomes a rain of kisses (&lsquo;she has not stopped kissing my feet&rsquo;, Jesus approvingly observes) while she anoints and massages his feet with a rich ointment. The ritualized nature of her actions is impossible to miss: she washes and anoints Jesus&rsquo; feet as priests in a temple would wash and anoint the cult statue of a god, simultaneously acknowledging and marking its sacred status. But the intense sensuality of the scene also communicates an eroticism many have found discomforting &ndash; including the Pharisee in the story, who is shocked that Jesus should let a sinful woman touch him in such a way. It is a scene emphasizing the overwhelming sensuous excesses of her body. By using her flowing hair, wet skin, and the repeated actions of her mouth and hands to caress Jesus&rsquo; feet, her actions take on the characteristics of sexual stimulation and erotic play, as seen in visual and literary works across the contemporaneous Graeco-Roman world &ndash; including Petronius&rsquo; Satyricon, where long-haired slave-boys anoint the feet of diners at a lascivious banquet, winding garlands around their ankles. It is an experience Luke&rsquo;s Jesus endorses at the close of the story &ndash; and is one of the most erotically charged scenes in the Gospels. Against this backdrop, the story in the later Gospel of John, describing Jesus washing his disciples&rsquo; feet, looks rather more suggestive. Stripping off his clothes and wrapping a towel around his waist, Jesus positions himself at the feet of his closest companions to perform a bathing ritual of sensory service, wiping his disciples&rsquo; feet dry with the towel about his groin and encouraging them to do the same to each other. It becomes a sensuous encounter, binding Jesus and his disciples together into a shared and intense bodily relationship. The erotic undertones of these biblical episodes are often missed by modern readers unfamiliar with the cultural contours of the ancient world and unaccustomed to the notion of a sexualized Christ. But for the earliest followers of Jesus, steeped in Jewish traditions, the feet were already eroticized and closely associated with sexual activity, and in the Hebrew Bible, they often serve euphemistically as a stand-in for genitalia. In the book of Ruth, for example, the eponymous heroine is instructed by her dead husband&rsquo;s mother to seduce the landowner Boaz by oiling herself with perfume, uncovering his &lsquo;feet&rsquo; while he&rsquo;s asleep and positioning herself there. (&lsquo;And then he will tell you what to do&rsquo;, her mother-in-law adds, with the voice of experience.) Ruth remains at Boaz&rsquo;s &lsquo;feet&rsquo; all night, and succeeds in conceiving a child. Elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, husbands wet their &lsquo;feet&rsquo; with (or &lsquo;in&rsquo;) their wives at home; women&rsquo;s skirts are forcefully lifted to expose their &lsquo;feet&rsquo; in public acts of sexual abuse and humiliation; wanton women whose genitalia deserve to be shamefully exposed are those who &lsquo;jingle with their feet&rsquo; as they walk in sandals and anklets decorated with tiny bells; and adulterous women are those whose feet &lsquo;do not stay at home&rsquo; but walk about the city by night and stand on street corners. These biblical traditions reflect a sexualizing of the feet attested in Mesopotamian literature of a similar period. In a seventh-century BCE Assyrian text, for example, the scribe god Nabu praises the goddess Tashmetu with enraptured delight as the divine woman &lsquo;whose thighs are a gazelle in the plain; whose ankle bones are an apple of Simian; whose heels are obsidian; whose whole being is a tablet of lapis lazuli!&rsquo;48 It is a lyrical expression of sexual desire akin to the biblical Song of Songs, in which the male lover revels in the erotic beauty of his beloved&rsquo;s legs and feet: &lsquo;How graceful are your feet in sandals, O queenly maiden! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand!&rsquo;49 Against this rich cultural backdrop, the fetishizing of Jesus&rsquo; feet as the site of both religious and erotic veneration is unsurprising &ndash; and persistent. Extending across centuries of Christianity, sexualized encounters with Christ&rsquo;s feet litter the religious works of theologians, bishops, monks and mystics. In the closing decades of the fourth century, Jerome was battling his sexual urges while on ascetic retreat in the Syrian desert, likening himself to the sensuous sinner of Luke&rsquo;s Gospel: &lsquo;Helpless, I cast myself at the feet of Jesus, I watered them with my tears, I wiped them with my hair, and then I subdued my rebellious body with weeks of abstinence&rsquo;. At around the same time, Bishop Paulinus of Nola was fantasizing about touching the heel of Christ with the tip of his tongue so that he could &lsquo;lick the divine feet&rsquo;. In the twelfth century, the Cistercian monk Bernard of Clairvaux was writing with fevered passion about his desire to move his mouth up the body of Christ, his &lsquo;tender lover&rsquo;, kissing first his feet, and then his hand, and then his mouth. In the fifteenth century, the English mystic Margery Kempe was caressing Christ&rsquo;s feet and toes in a series of erotic visions in which he commanded her to treat him as her lover and her husband. The fixation with divine feet was not confined to Christians during this lengthy period. Within ancient and medieval Judaism, too, some rabbis rhetorically stripped and gazed upon the body of God, fixing their eyes particularly on his feet as the anatomical parts traditionally associated in the Hebrew Bible with the revelation of the divine body. From as early as the second century CE and continuing into the eighth, rabbinic debate about the presence of God frequently circled back to biblical references to God&rsquo;s feet and footstool. In contrast to a theological preference in mainstream Judaism today to read these references metaphorically or symbolically, certain rabbinic traditions celebrated the wonder of God&rsquo;s feet in ways that married the mysterious, transcendent nature of God with ever more tangible ways of experiencing his presence. Accordingly, in some Talmudic and midrashic texts, it is assumed that God leaves humanlike footprints on the rocks and mountains on which he stands; in others, the feet of God are so intimate a part of his body that he conceals them from human eyes, but reveals their impact in the world in the clouds of dust he kicks up as he walks. Even the personified Shekhinah &ndash; the &lsquo;indwelling&rsquo; or &lsquo;presence&rsquo; of God in the world &ndash; was assumed by some rabbis to have feet, which might be revealed or concealed by clouds, or be soiled or pushed away from the earth by the transgressions of worshippers. In early Jewish mysticism, intense scholarly speculation about the corporeal nature of God&rsquo;s feet climaxed with the Shi&lsquo;ur Qomah (&lsquo;measurement of the body&rsquo;) &ndash; a literary collection of much older traditions, in circulation by the twelfth century CE. In this work, the measurements of God&rsquo;s body were calculated and the secret names of its anatomical parts discerned. In particular, the claim in the book of Isaiah that the earth was the footstool of God was taken as a handy guide to the enormous size of God&rsquo;s feet, measured in spatial units known as parasangs &ndash; each one roughly equivalent to three miles: The soles of his feet fill the entire universe, as it is said: &lsquo;&ldquo;The heavens are my throne and the earth is my footstool&rdquo;&rsquo;. The length of his soles is 30,000,000 parasangs . . . From his foot till his ankle [the distance is] 10,000,500 parasangs in its height [on the right side] and thus also on the left side. In measuring the feet of God, Jewish mystics were not trying to impoverish the glory of God by rendering him more like a man, as an appalled Maimonides (Rambam) contested in the twelfth century CE. Rather, they were using a specialized religious logic to demonstrate the incomprehensible, uncontainable nature of the divine. To a certain extent, the medieval mystical tradition was keeping alive God&rsquo;s ancient mythological past in ways classical rabbinic Judaism and Western Christianity could not &ndash; or would not. But it is within a collection of medieval mystical traditions known as the Zohar that the fetishization of God&rsquo;s feet is most explicitly sexualized. Emerging in thirteenth-century Spain, but claimed to derive from the visions and homilies of a wandering band of Roman-era Palestinian sages and rabbis, the Zohar decodes and then recodes biblical texts and Jewish teachings, and is the foundational literature of later Kabbalah and Hasidism. At its heart is the notion that something of the inscrutable, infinite God (Ein Sof) can be grasped via the world of the sefirot &ndash; the ten interactive &lsquo;dimensions&rsquo; or &lsquo;emanations&rsquo; of God in the created world (such as goodness, justice, separation and wisdom) by which humans can experience divine responsiveness. Within this highly esoteric, multilayered theological scheme, God is not only embodied, but the divine body comprises male and female principles, which can engage tenderly and sexually with one another. Encouraged by the biblical tendency to associate the feet with genitalia, the sexualized masculinity of God (a form of the ninth dimension, known as Yesod) is frequently correlated with his feet, with which the feminine aspect of the presence of God, the Shekhinah (cast as the tenth dimension) engages and unites, erotically and sexually. In the Zohar, God&rsquo;s feet become powerfully coded symbols of the spiritualized divine penis. It is often assumed that this highly specialized, mystical sexualizing of God&rsquo;s feet was a scandalous but anomalous innovation of its time. But this is mistaken. The fetishizing of the divine feet was already a well established feature of centuries of Jewish and Christian traditions. The medieval mystics contributing to the Zohar were simply drawing anew on a rich biblical heritage of cosmic mythology in order to better understand the intimate relationship between God and humans. Deeply embedded within this mythology was the ancient idea that God had always been a sexual deity. And in the Bible, he had the genitals to prove it.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.4mf10ofk5ibc"><span class="c6">Part 2 GENITALS</span></h2><h1 class="c1" id="h.6nu4ofnmko4n"><span class="c4">Chapter 5</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;COVER UP </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hidden behind the walls of a monastery in the small Italian town of Bassano Romano is one of the most sensational sculptures in the history of Western art. In the monastery&rsquo;s church of San Vincenzo Martire, tucked away inside a tiny sacristy, is the Risen Christ &ndash; a masterpiece of Renaissance spirituality, hewn from creamy marble by Michelangelo. Christ stands almost seven feet tall, holding upright the large, heavy cross on which he was killed. He leans casually into the cross, his strong arms comfortably bearing its bulk. Bundled in one hand are the accessories of his execution: a rope, thickly coiled, and the sponge used to wet his drying, dying lips. From his other hand dangles his abandoned death shroud. His face is turned away from the cross as he gazes down at the new world his resurrection has created. His burly body is athletically taut, recalling the classical statuary of Greek culture so beloved by the artist and his contemporaries. Like his Greek forebears, the Risen Christ of Bassano Romano is confidently, magnificently nude: beneath a tidy crescent of pubic hair, his petite, relaxed penis rests on a fleshy, rounded scrotum. Jesus&rsquo; genitals are unashamedly displayed (Plate 6). The statue was largely ignored until the art world rediscovered it in 1997, which swiftly led to its identification as Michelangelo&rsquo;s first attempt at this particular composition. Commissioned in 1514 for the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome, the statue had disappeared from public view when the artist abandoned his nearly completed creation upon discovering a long dark vein in the marble, disfiguring the face of Christ. He began again with a fresh block of stone, and it is this second version that still stands in its intended home in Rome.1 It too is a nude Christ &ndash; or at least it was, until a gaudy bronze loincloth was fixed to the statue in 1546, veiling the penis and testicles from view. Tarnished with age, the modesty device remains to this day. So too do the fluttering draperies and flimsy britches painted in 1565 over the genitals and buttocks of the writhing nude figures populating Michelangelo&rsquo;s monumental Last Judgement (1534&ndash;42), in the Sistine Chapel. &lsquo;All those figures showing their nakedness so shamelessly&rsquo;, the papal master of ceremonies, Biagio de Cesena, is reported to have exclaimed upon seeing the enormous fresco as it neared completion. The poet Pietro Aretino was equally appalled: &lsquo;Your art would be at home in some voluptuous bagnio [brothel], certainly not in the highest chapel of the world&rsquo;, he wrote to Michelangelo in 1545. &lsquo;Less criminal were it if you were an infidel, than, being a believer, thus to sap the faith of others&rsquo;.2 The censoring of Michelangelo&rsquo;s work was just one of a number of Counter-Reformation strategies adopted by bishops, priests and theologians in the wake of the Council of Trent (1545&ndash;63) to tackle what had come to be seen as the scandalous profanity of frontal nudity in Christian art.3 No matter that Michelangelo, like many of his predecessors and peers, used the nude theologically to celebrate the humanity and masculinity of the divine Christ. For too many, the genitals were both spiritually and morally dangerous, and were thus to be hidden from view. This was far from a new idea. The genitals have long functioned as a site of religious and cultural anxiety in human societies. Simultaneously associated with sex, reproduction and urination, the places and spaces between our legs trigger deep-rooted social and cultural concerns &ndash; particularly about their public display &ndash; and are coded with values and meanings in ways many other body parts are not. These values and meanings are closely linked to the generative and changeable physiology of our genitals. After all, they are places of potent physical transformation. Pubic hair grows, greys and fades as we age. Vaginas open, expand and contract during sex and in labour, and are the entry and exit points at which new life is brought into the world. Penises alternate from small and soft to large and hard as erections come and go. Scrotums, labia and clitorises similarly enlarge and engorge, and shrink and retreat, at the stimulus of touch and temperature. Genital skin is recurrently moistened and scented by the body&rsquo;s natural lubricants and the wetness of sexual arousal, or by menstruation, ejaculation and the expulsion of urine. Our genitals are subject to changes in appearance, touch, smell, function and form more than any other part of our bodies. They are powerfully transformative. And like other manifestations of power and transformation, they are potentially dangerous &ndash; unless carefully harnessed or managed by the social and cultural preferences of the communities in which we live. It is for this reason that human societies past and present at once celebrate and denigrate the genitals. Some cultures might decorate, cut, pierce, cover, or expose the genitals of certain groups. In some societies, people might find themselves temporarily or permanently maligned or marginalized given the relative status of their genitalia &ndash; menstruating women, the impotent, the infertile, the sick, those who are intersex, or those who are transgender. But it is the covering of the sexual organs that is the most common form of genital regulation in human societies. In the modern West, as in many other cultures, an adult&rsquo;s genitals are to be covered most of the time. Their uncovering in social settings tends to occur only in certain circumstances: during sex with someone else; in a medical context; or when the social norms surrounding the exposure of the genitals are deliberately flouted, whether subversively, pornographically, or abusively. Our genitals have become our &lsquo;private&rsquo; parts. And yet they remain socially powerful. What we do with our genitalia &ndash; and how we do it, where we do it, and with whom &ndash; is inextricably linked to the identity politics and associated power play of wider society. From shifting ideas about gender, sexuality, appearance and dress, to nebulous concepts as varied as virginity, adulthood, status and decency, our genitals are in many ways public property, at once privileged and protected, feared and shamed. By covering our genitals, we render them culturally visible.4 In the West, our complicated relationship with our genitals has been heavily shaped by the fallout from the most famous of cover-ups: the donning of fig leaves in the Garden of Eden. The story is told in the book of Genesis, in which Eve takes fruit from a forbidden tree and gives it to Adam. They eat, and the eyes of the first man and woman are pointedly said to be &lsquo;opened&rsquo;. They suddenly perceive their bodies differently: they are not simply bare, but &lsquo;undressed&rsquo;. Adam and Eve sew fig leaves together to make coverings to fix around their waists, and further conceal their bodies in the foliage of the garden when they hear God approaching. Having cursed them for their disobedience with a promise of hard agricultural and maternal labour, God expels them from Eden.5 In the hands of early Christian theologians, this story about human misbehaviour became a morality tale about the dangers of the flesh. &lsquo;They turned their eyes on their own genitals, and lusted after them with that stirring movement they had not previously known&rsquo;, conjectured the fifthcentury CE bishop Augustine of Hippo &ndash; a Christian convert and reformed womanizer, who knew the hazardous allures of the body all too well.6 His formulation of humanity&rsquo;s &lsquo;original sin&rsquo; would quickly become a central doctrine of the Western Church. Eve became a temptress who led her husband into religious deviancy. Transgression led to sexualization, rendering innocent nudity shameful nakedness. The first humans fell away from God, exchanging the easy intimacy of the garden for the sweat, pain and unruly sexual desire of the carnal world. Salvation from original sin, congenitally inherited by all humans, was only to be found in Christ &ndash; the celibate, sinless counterpart to Adam &ndash; who was birthed into the world by Mary &ndash; the virginal, uncorrupted foil to Eve. Woeful shame and dangerous lust have infected our genitals ever since. And yet there is nothing in the biblical story of Eden to suggest that the covering of the genitals reflects the sin of sexuality. Rather, it is a tale about the disobedience of Adam and Eve, and the threat they now pose to God, who shares with his divine colleagues in the heavenly council his worry that, in acquiring wisdom, the humans have become &lsquo;like one of us&rsquo;.7 They are akin to gods. Their rudimentary clothing marks this transformed, elevated status &ndash; a new status further acknowledged by God himself, who replaces their flimsy fig leaves with more durable outfits of leather, made by his own hand. Beyond the bounds of the garden, humans immediately harness their newfound wisdom to do as the gods have always done: they bear children, cultivate crops and rear animals; they kill, travel, play music, build cities, forge tools, craft weapons and perform rituals. In covering their genitals, Adam and Eve reveal not their sexualized self-corruption, but their godlike capacity for the creation of culture.8 The distortion of this story by early theologians is just one episode in the long history of a ferocious Christian hostility towards sex and the genitals. It was a hostility shaped in part by the acute ascetic tendencies of certain ancient and classical Greek philosophies, including aspects of Stoicism and Platonism, in which the base and the bodily were sharply distinguished from the sublime and the immaterial. But it was also a view firmly embedded within the earliest authoritative writings of Christianity. In his letter to Christian communities in Roman Galatia, in what is now Turkey, the self-declared apostle Paul draws a pointed distinction between the carnal and the divine: &lsquo;Live by the spirit, I say, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh. For what the flesh desires is opposed to the spirit, and what the spirit desires is opposed to the flesh&rsquo;.9 For those unwilling or unable to renounce sex, as he told Christians in Corinth, it was better to marry as a means of &lsquo;containing&rsquo; passion, lest the body became so &lsquo;aflame&rsquo; that all self-control would be lost.10 For Paul, an out-and-proud celibate himself, the holy and the horny could not and should not mix. It was an austere asceticism seemingly endorsed by Christ himself in texts circulating among early Christian communities across south-west Asia, the Mediterranean and North Africa &ndash; including the Gospels (which date from the latter half of the first century CE). Here, Jesus often appears as an extremist who opposes traditional forms of household kinship and its sexual dynamics. He frequently undermines the social worth of marriage and childbirth in favour of an androcentric model of family in which male believers are bound together by faith, not blood: &lsquo;Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple&rsquo;.11 Although he strongly condemns adultery, divorce and remarriage, the Jesus of the New Testament Gospels presents marriage and childbirth (and by strong implication, sex itself) as a relic of a former age of spiritual ignorance that his death and resurrection would destroy.12 By the second century CE, this hostility had intensified. In an important text known as the Acts of Thomas, the risen Jesus suddenly appears in the bedchamber of a couple on their wedding night, urging them not to have sex: &lsquo;Know that if you refrain from this filthy intercourse, you become temples holy and pure . . . and you will not be involved in the cares of life and of children, whose end is destruction&rsquo;. Suffer little children, indeed. Meanwhile, in the Gospel of Thomas (another influential work), Jesus goes further, casting childlessness as a divine blessing: &lsquo;The days will come when you will say, &ldquo;Blessed is the womb which has not conceived and the breasts that have not given suck&rdquo; &rsquo;.13 The conception and raising of children was not only considered a distracting impediment to believers, but a salvific irrelevance. According to Luke&rsquo;s Gospel, Jesus had warned of the futility of sexual reproduction because disaster was coming: &lsquo;Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people&rsquo;.14 Indeed, many early Christians &ndash; including Paul and the Gospel writers &ndash; believed that the world as they knew it was about to end, for it was to be swept away by the Kingdom of God, in which there would be no place for sex nor need for procreation. Instead, believers would enjoy eternal life in celibate, heavenly bodies akin to those of angels. The world did not come to an end. Yet neither did Christianity die with its first followers. Unsurprisingly, early Christian sex advice appears not to have been wildly popular, for believers continued having children. Although virginity and celibacy would long be idealized as the pious behaviour of the most devout, Christian teaching on marriage and procreation quickly became more accommodating to sexual reproduction, drawing closer to the traditional values of mainstream Jewish groups, for whom marital sex had long been lauded as a pleasurable activity essential to the religious well-being of both husband and wife, and the flourishing of the family. Indeed, sex in marriage was commanded in the Torah by God himself, who had insisted that a newly married man must remain at home for a year in order &lsquo;to give pleasure to his wife&rsquo;.15 By the second century CE, some Jewish laws were stipulating that a man must have sex with his wife at least once a week, and seek her permission before taking a job that would require prolonged absences from the marital bed.16 Against this cultural backdrop, however, sexual activities beyond the bounds of marriage &ndash; including adultery, prostitution and same-sex relationships &ndash; were deemed antisocial and religiously deviant by both early Jewish and Christian leaders. These activities undermined or upturned the building blocks of marriage, household, kinship and inheritance on which society was constructed. Sexual deviancy was consequently considered offensive to God, for it was contrary to his intentions for humanity. As authoritatively depicted in the first chapter of Genesis, sex was cast as a human activity commanded by God, and yet distanced from him. Set within a cosmic framework of divine creation, its primary purpose was to fulfil God&rsquo;s life-giving instruction that humans &lsquo;be fruitful and multiply&rsquo; &ndash; a blessing issued at the point of humanity&rsquo;s creation.17 The birthing of children was closely tied to the mortality of every generation; humanity could only continue to exist by reproducing &ndash; setting them apart from their creator, for whom existence was perpetual. God thus neither needed nor desired sex. Despite the divine blessing of sex within marriage, an inherent opposition of the sexualized body and the divine was deeply embedded within ancient Jewish and Christian cultures. To a certain extent, it was already modelled in the very language of the scriptures themselves, in which references to the sexualized body were euphemistically controlled or poetically presented. In keeping with long-established cultural norms across ancient south-west Asia, the vocabulary used in literature to describe or refer to the genitals tended towards colloquialism, euphemism, allusion and wordplay. Common linguistic strategies to describe the sex organs included concrete terms for tools and weapons for male genitals (bow, arrow, staff, rod, plough), and domestic or horticultural language for female genitals (water-well, churn, field, garden, fruit). Other body parts frequently served as stand-ins for the genitals, particularly &lsquo;hand&rsquo;, &lsquo;thigh&rsquo;, &lsquo;limb&rsquo;, or &lsquo;flesh&rsquo; for the penis, &lsquo;lips&rsquo; and &lsquo;mouth&rsquo; for the vulva, and &lsquo;feet&rsquo; for the genitals of any type of body. Abstractions, too, were especially common for male sex organs: &lsquo;nakedness&rsquo;, &lsquo;strength&rsquo; and &lsquo;virility&rsquo; are frequently attested. These linguistic tics are arguably a reflex of common cultural anxieties surrounding the sexual organs &ndash; a reflex similarly pervading modern societies. Both British and North American English, for example, enjoy a rich spread of genital vocabulary, from the formal (penis, testicles, vulva, vagina) and the politely veiled (privates, bits, John Thomas, lady garden), to the childish (willy, winky, foo-foo, vajayjay) and the vulgar (cock, prick, pussy, cunt, gash). But in ancient south-west Asian cultures, the literary veiling of the genitals did not render the sexualized body invisible; on the contrary, the elasticity of euphemism made room for deeply erotic reflections on the sexualized body. Take, for example, this sensuous description of bodies readying themselves for sex, in which the wetness of male and female arousal is played out in a flirtatious fantasy: I was sleeping but my heart was awake. Listen! My lover is knocking! &lsquo;Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one, for my head is drenched with dew, my locks with the drops of the night!&rsquo; I have taken off my robe; am I to put it on again? I have bathed my feet; am I to get them dirty? My lover reached his hand into the opening, at which my body thrilled. I rose to open to my lover, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers, flowing myrrh, on the handles of the bolt. This beautiful love lyric appears in the Bible. It is an extract from the Song of Songs (5.2&ndash;5), a Hellenistic-era compilation of older meditations on the pain and pleasure of sexual desire &ndash; a compilation that was so beloved of the scribal cultures of ancient Jerusalem that it found its way into the canonical collections of both Judaism and Christianity.18 But as the authority of certain religious texts grew &ndash; including the Song of Songs &ndash; colloquial and euphemistic words for the genitals acquired an additional veneer of reverential modesty: both early Jewish and Christian interpretations of biblical literature increasingly privileged the metaphorical and abstract over the poetic and corporeal, effectively distancing the sacred from the all-too-human realities of sex. What had come to be understood as the written word of God could not be tainted by the gauche, seductive, or scandalous intrusion of genital language. It was a theological tendency encouraged by the careful separation of the sexualized human body from the divine, which had long been expressed in the Torah and other early Jewish texts in the form of strict ritual regulations surrounding mortals&rsquo; encounters with sacred space. Scholars are unsure of the extent to which these restrictive regulations were imposed and obeyed, but they indicate nonetheless deep anxiety about the management of human genitals in religious contexts. And carefully managed they were. Just as priests were instructed to remove their shoes and wash their feet before entering the house of God, so too were they ordered to ensure not only that their genitals were covered, but that beneath their long tunics, penises and testicles were tightly secured with close-fitting, high-quality linen underpants, which effectively &lsquo;neutralized&rsquo; &ndash; and symbolically neutered &ndash; the sexualized bodies of priests.19 Uncontrolled, loose genitals were clearly not appropriate in the presence of God. Worse still were &lsquo;leaky&rsquo; genitals, which were considered ritually toxic. According to the book of Leviticus, men who had recently ejaculated, or women who had recently had sex, were considered &lsquo;unclean&rsquo; or &lsquo;impure&rsquo; &ndash; in other words, they were unfit for ritual activity, posing a danger both to the sanctity of sacred space and to its personnel. Consequently, these men and women were not to approach such space until they had performed a day-long purification ceremony at home. Menstruating women, or those bleeding after childbirth, were even more dangerous, demanding not only extended periods of ritual purification (of at least a week), but also the daylong purification of anyone who might come into contact with them or the items their bodies had touched. Similar strategies were also employed to deal with anyone suffering a genital discharge prompted by infection or illness. Even after the final destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE, these regulations &ndash; and the rabbinic debates they sparked &ndash; remained potent within Jewish worship, impacting synagogue and study-house attendance for both men and women.20 Jewish concerns about the genitals were inevitably carried into early Christian worship and its liturgical precepts. Encouraged by the procelibacy theology of salvation promoted by Paul and other prominent community leaders, early Christians of both Jewish and Gentile cultural identity shared (and squabbled over) anxieties about the potential religious hazards of their genitals. As the small house cults of earliest Christian meetings gave way to more formalized, public and increasingly &lsquo;sacred&rsquo; venues of worship, restrictions triggered by the sexualized body intensified. Long before infant baptism became a Christian norm, baptism as an initiation into the faith was originally more akin to a spiritual coming-ofage ritual for adults &ndash; and in some communities it was undertaken either wholly undressed or nearly so, in order to ensure the &lsquo;holy&rsquo; water thoroughly coated the body. But this set the sexually mature body and the anxieties it provoked at the very heart of believers&rsquo; most sacred rites. The transformative power of baptism likely addressed some of these anxieties, as a stunning sixth-century mosaic set into the ceiling of the Arian Baptistery in Ravenna, Italy, would later attest. Flanked by John the Baptist and the god of the Jordan River, an adolescent Jesus is immersed up to his waist in the river waters. He is completely naked &ndash; and his genitals are clearly visible. Beardless and youthful, this striking image of Jesus points to the notion of a sin-free nudity akin to that originally enjoyed by Adam and Eve in Eden (Plate 7). But while childlike nakedness or partial nudity in baptism had been variously encouraged or idealized in the earliest centuries of Christianity, discomfort with the exposed or &lsquo;undressed&rsquo; body steadily grew. These anxieties centred as much around issues of identity and difference as they did theological worries concerning the raw exposure of the flesh, so that Christians increasingly sought to distinguish their immersion rituals from those of traditional Jewish practice, as well as the bathing cultures of Graeco-Roman civic life, in which nudity or partial nudity was more usual. Just as significantly, &lsquo;naked&rsquo; baptism would also trigger wider concerns about the ritual roles of women. Some early Christian women likely selfadministered baptism in small, private groups to maintain bodily privacy and spare male blushes. But many feared women had been granted too much ritual power in the performance of what remains one of Christianity&rsquo;s most important sacraments. As churches spread and their membership diversified, apostolic authority birthed powerful priesthoods, rendering baptisms more public, ceremonial and heavily regulated. Male priests now baptized both men and women &ndash; and so genitals and buttocks were hastily hidden.21 For most early Christian communities, however, it was the actively &lsquo;polluting&rsquo; nature of the female sex organs and the ritual risks inherent in the aftermath of male ejaculation that proved most problematic. Some groups forbade menstruating and post-partum women both from baptism and Eucharist, while in many communities the temporary exclusion of women who had recently given birth from all forms of worship would eventually be extended in the more common rite of &lsquo;churching&rsquo;. In many churches, leaders advised any man or woman who had recently been exposed to semen to delay their participation in worship &ndash; whether private prayer or communal celebration. Even the impact of a wet dream upon a man&rsquo;s ability to draw closer to Christ in worship was a point of contention in the first centuries of the faith. Understood as an involuntary ejaculation prompted by latent lust or demonic stimulation, a wet dream muddied the growing conventions surrounding the careful religious management of the sexualized body. Some considered it an unwilling if unseemly emission that should not impinge upon spiritual development and acceptance by Christ. For others, however, it was a devilish sign of the weak and corrupted flesh and demanded immediate rectification by means of penitence or temporary exclusion from worship.22 Even in sleep, the genitals were dangerous. Despite the differences within and between early Jewish and Christian communities, all appeared to agree that the regulation of the genitals hinged around perceptions of sacred time and sacred place. Priests, rabbis and worshippers alike were duty-bound to ensure their sex organs were in the right state at the right time before entering into the presence of God. Essentially, genitals were to be considered an aspect of the human condition, not the divine. And yet the body of the God of the Bible suggests otherwise. Cocksure Exposure It was in the thirtieth year of his life, in the fourth month of that year, and on the fifth day of that month, says the Jerusalem priest Ezekiel ben Buzi, that he saw God. Like most ritual specialists, Ezekiel appears to have been a stickler for precision. After all, the timing, placement and properties of religious ceremonies were not simply the routines of tradition, but the magical mechanics by which the divine realm was accessed. Despite his exile to Nippur, in Babylonia, following the conquest of Judah (597 BCE), this Jerusalem temple priest nonetheless retained his eye for detail. In the opening chapter of the biblical book bearing his name, Ezekiel describes his vision of God in sumptuous &ndash; if at times baffling &ndash; detail. He sees a large dark cloud enveloped by flashes of fire, with a shining brightness emanating from within. Inside the cloud are four giant cherubim &ndash; the enormous hybrid beings who accompany the deity. Each one has four faces (one human, one leonine, one bovine and one like an eagle). He describes their legs (straight), their feet (bronzed hooves) and their wings (four each, with human hands attached), which create a thundering rumble as they move. Above the cherubim, he sees a wheeled, mobile throne of lapis lazuli, upon which is seated a figure whose form is &lsquo;like a human being&rsquo;. It is God. He has rolled himself out of Jerusalem on his throne to join his priest in Babylonia. As Ezekiel describes God, he knows exactly where to look and what to say &ndash; or rather, where to look and what not to say. His gaze sweeps up and down God&rsquo;s body, but he no longer describes precisely what he sees. Instead, he veils the deity in the religious language of glorious, mysterious spectacle: &lsquo;Upward from what looked to be his motnayim, I saw it sparkling like amber, it seemed to be enveloped all around by fire. And from his motnayim downward I saw something like fire. And brilliance surrounded him. Like the bow in a cloud on a rainy day, this was the appearance of the brilliance all around.&rsquo;23 This enigmatic language is a canny priestly distancing device, designed to reverently conceal the divine body from the eyes of the uninitiated. But Ezekiel leaves exposed one body part: God&rsquo;s motnayim, a Hebrew term traditionally (and politely) rendered &lsquo;loins&rsquo; or &lsquo;waist&rsquo;, but which more accurately refers to the groin and its genitals.24 Ezekiel might shy away from describing God&rsquo;s face, his torso, his arms, legs and feet, but he openly acknowledges God&rsquo;s genitals, navigating his visual journey up and down the divine body by means of the godly groin. It is not only a stunning display of the graphic corporeality of God, but a theological manifestation of the distance and difference between mortals and God: if in Genesis human bodies are made culturally visible by the covering of their genitals, in Ezekiel, God&rsquo;s body is mysteriously, transcendently concealed by the exposure of his. Ezekiel is not the only biblical figure to acknowledge God&rsquo;s genitals. The prophet Isaiah is said to have had a similarly intimate encounter with the deity almost a century and a half earlier, in the mid eighth century BCE. In a scene still celebrated in Jewish and Christian prayer, Isaiah enters the inner sanctum of the Jerusalem temple and sees God enthroned. The deity is accompanied by seraphim &ndash; fiery flying serpents &ndash; each equipped with three pairs of wings. With one set they cover their faces; with another, they cover their genitals (euphemistically described as &lsquo;feet&rsquo;); with the other, they soar about the throne, crying out, &lsquo;Holy, holy, holy is Yahweh of Hosts! The whole earth is full of his glory!&rsquo;25 The temple shakes with the sound of their voices; its air thickens with the heady smoke of incense. The prophet was overwhelmed. &lsquo;My eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Hosts!&rsquo; Isaiah exclaims. &lsquo;I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, tall and lofty! His lower extremities filled the temple!&rsquo;26 It is an image of divine gigantism we have come to expect. The huge throne seats a deity so large his &lsquo;lower extremities&rsquo; cram the sanctuary. Most ancient and modern translators reverently assume it is the hem of Yahweh&rsquo;s great robe that swamps the space. But Isaiah makes no mention of a robe. Rather, the Hebrew term he employs to refer to the deity&rsquo;s &lsquo;lower extremities&rsquo;, shul, is more commonly used by biblical prophets not to refer to the edges of garments, but to pointedly allude to the fleshy realities of the sexual organs.27 In this vision in Isaiah, God&rsquo;s genitals are enormous. No wonder the seraphim coyly position their wings over their own. Like temple priests donning underpants, their covering gesture in the divine throne room acknowledges their humble stature in the presence of the well-endowed deity they praise. The scale of Yahweh&rsquo;s genitalia is to be expected &ndash; not only because it belongs to a supersized body, but because Yahweh&rsquo;s cultural father, the aged deity El, was similarly well equipped. In the mythological stories enshrined on the clay tablets of cosmopolitan Ugarit (c.1350&ndash;1200 BCE), El&rsquo;s penis makes several appearances. In one myth, the god sets out along the serpentine seashore at the edge of the world, where he encounters two young goddesses. They urge him to get an erection and take them in body and marriage. The response is unambiguous: &lsquo;El&rsquo;s penis grew as long as the sea, El&rsquo;s penis [grew as long] as the ocean&rsquo;. Having installed them as brides in his home, he grasps his penis in his right hand and &lsquo;shoots&rsquo; it skyward, like an arrow, to entice his new wives into consummating the marriage. They are suitably impressed with his masturbatory performance. El stoops to kiss them, relishing the pomegranate-sweet taste of their &lsquo;lips&rsquo; &ndash; a delicately sensuous double entendre. Penetrative sex quickly follows, and El impregnates the goddesses, who bear him the &lsquo;gracious gods&rsquo; Shahar (&lsquo;Dawn&rsquo;) and Shalem (&lsquo;Dusk&rsquo;).28 El&rsquo;s penis may have enthused his young brides, but his primary wife, the great mother goddess Athirat, is not as easily impressed by his penchant for occasional genital exhibition. When she visits her husband in the Baal Cycle of myths, Athirat is on a mission to secure El&rsquo;s approval for the construction of a palace for Baal. Delighted to see her, El assumes her needs are bodily and scrambles to sate her appetites. He offers her rich food and fine wine &ndash; and then his penis: &lsquo;Does the penis of El the King excite you? Does the love-organ of the Bull arouse you? &rsquo;29 Ignoring both his penis and his questions, Athirat simply presses on with her petition. With the worldweary strategy goddesses were often forced to deploy, she tactfully flatters him not with sexual compliments, but appeals to his great wisdom to win her case. In this story, El&rsquo;s self-titling as &lsquo;Bull&rsquo; is just as revealing as the flaunting of his penis. The bull was an enduring ancient symbol of an aggressively potent, unrestrained hyper-masculinity. It manifested military might, sexual prowess and divine generative power. These were the qualities of the masculine gods of creation, who harnessed the wildness of chaos to impose order upon the cosmos and bring fecundity into the world. It is an ancient and sophisticated constellation of religious ideas, offering an image of a raw, animalized sexual virility that is celebrated in a Sumerian myth dated to about 2000 BCE*. In this remarkably vivid tale, the high god Enki &ndash; himself &lsquo;engendered by a [divine] bull, begotten by a wild bull&rsquo; &ndash; fertilizes the world by digging irrigation ditches with his penis and creating the great rivers of Mesopotamia with his semen: &lsquo;After Father Enki had lifted his eyes across the Euphrates, he stood up full of lust like a rampant bull, lifted his penis, ejaculated, and filled the Euphrates with flowing water . . . By lifting his penis, he brought a bridal gift. The Tigris rejoiced in its heart, like a great wild bull, when it was born&rsquo;.30 In the same myth, Enki&rsquo;s penetrative, bodily presence in the heavens, in the meadows and in the rivers stimulates an abundance of rains, a high carp-flood and an accumulation of grains and fruits. As the god of fresh waters, Enki&rsquo;s semen quite literally enlivens the cosmos. It is in these phallic acts of creation that he proves himself a high god and divine progenitor par excellence (fig. 13). This fertile potency was a characteristic shared across millennia with other masculine deities closely associated with the bull, or to whom the epithet &lsquo;Bull&rsquo; was approvingly applied. These included the Egyptian god of male sexuality, Min, who was consistently depicted in art with an impressively permanent erection; the deity Amun-Re, who frequently adopted Min&rsquo;s phallic iconography (fig. 14); and their venerable colleague Atum, a god of creation, who famously declared that, from the very beginning, he &lsquo;came into being ithyphallic&rsquo;. Alongside El at Ugarit, the god Baal used what is described as his &lsquo;tumescent&rsquo; penis to mate with a heifer, fathering the wild bull who impregnated the city&rsquo;s cattle. The Assyrian storm-god Adad was often depicted standing atop a great bull, while various unidentified goddesses across the region are depicted upon a divine bull, commanding its virility &ndash; an image seemingly recast and abased in the famous Greek myth of Zeus&rsquo; sexual abduction of Europa, whom he carries off across the sea on his back while disguised as a bull. Among these highstatus deities, it is no surprise to find that Yahweh, too, was often understood as the divine bull. Bovine language (the Hebrew term abbir) underlies his biblical designation as the &lsquo;Mighty One [abir] of Jacob&rsquo; who grants genital fertility to the Israelite tribe of Joseph, and in some biblical texts, Yahweh&rsquo;s cult statue is said to take the form of a bull or a bull calf.31 Fig. 13. Enki&rsquo;s innate fertility is vividly portrayed in this detail from a cylinder seal, dated to about 2250 BCE. Known in this particular context by his Akkadian name Ea, his role as the god of fresh water is evident as two fish leap in the abundant streams issuing from his shoulders. His superior status is signalled by his seated position, as another deity politely stands before him. Fig. 14. A permanent erection was the iconographic hallmark of both the Egyptian god Min and a form of the creator god Amun-Re, who adopted Min&rsquo;s features and pose in his role as AmunKamutef (&lsquo;Amun-the-Bull-of-His-Mother&rsquo;). This image from the temple complex at Karnak shows Amun-Re as the self-generating ithyphallic god. Like the Sumerian god Enki, Yahweh&rsquo;s status as a fertile creator god of the highest order is also confirmed in the Bible with a fleeting portrayal of his sexual encounter with the earthly realm. Although the biblical writers (and their later translators) have done their best to sanitize the story by diluting Yahweh&rsquo;s corporeal sexuality, its erotic features nonetheless suggest that an older myth lurks in the background: the God of the Bible sexually takes the land of Israel as his wife (as signalled by the euphemistic use of the verb &lsquo;to know&rsquo;) and excites the cosmos into an aroused, mutually reproductive fecundity as he impregnates his bride at a place called Jezreel (&lsquo;He Seeds&rsquo;) &ndash; a region famed for its rich agricultural soils: I will take you for my wife in faithfulness, and you will &lsquo;know&rsquo; Yahweh. On that day, I will fructify &ndash; says Yahweh, I will fructify the heavens, and they will fructify the earth; and the earth will fructify the grain, the wine, and the oil, and they will fructify Jezreel; and I will seed her for myself in the land.32 In this poem in the book of Hosea, dated to about the eighth century BCE, Yahweh&rsquo;s penis may well be veiled from direct view, hidden behind a modesty screen of euphemism and wordplay, but the bodily, sexual connotations are impossible to miss. Like the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel, who bear witness to Yahweh&rsquo;s genitalia, the prophet Hosea is well aware that God is equipped with a penis &ndash; and it is large enough and potent enough to arouse and fertilize the heavens and the earth. In the ancient cultures of south-west Asia, a sizeable penis, and even its occasional overt exhibition, did not render male deities less godly, but appropriately divine. The imposing erect virility of masculine gods was vividly celebrated in these ancient societies and the religious literature they produced. Although these texts often employ the slick euphemisms and clever wordplay of artfully crafted contemporaneous erotic compositions, there is nothing to suggest a cultural discomfort with the earthy, corporeal sexuality of male gods and their giant penises. Nor should these traditions be assumed to reflect a &lsquo;primitive&rsquo; worldview or an unsophisticated causeand-effect &lsquo;nature&rsquo; religion, in which the sexual arousal of the gods mechanically stimulated the fecundity of the human environment. Indeed, these are views we owe as much to the xenophobic polemics of later Greek and Roman writers and artists, who preferred their cultural heroes to be modestly equipped with much smaller, &lsquo;civilized&rsquo; genitalia, as to the snobbish and orientalist theological disdain of later Western thinkers. Rather, the penises of ancient south-west Asian gods embodied a conspicuous and powerful hyper-masculinity deemed essential to the ordering, fruitfulness and well-being of the cosmos and its inhabitants. It was a cultural phallocentrism with which we are still familiar today.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.l73bitgechhn"><span class="c4">Chapter 6</span></h1><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">PHALLIC MASCULINITIES </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On 3 January 2018, US President Donald J. Trump opened a new front in his very public war of words with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un by boasting on social media about the size of his nuclear-launch button. &lsquo;Kim Jong Un just stated that the &ldquo;Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times&rdquo; &rsquo;, Trump tweeted in his customary idiosyncratic style. &lsquo;Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button&rsquo;, he continued, &lsquo;but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his, and my Button works!&rsquo;1 Whether enraptured or enraged, most Westerners understood the President&rsquo;s tweet not only as a claim to military supremacy, but as an assertion of masculine superiority, couched in the competitive terms more commonly associated with penis bragging. This is unsurprising. The relationship between nuclear weapons and phallic culture in the modern West is well established and easily recognized. &lsquo;Hard, phallic, projected toward the skies&rsquo;, as one scholar puts it, the symbolism of this terrifying weapon is far from implicit. Nor is it incidental. The first Western nuclear bombs were gendered male, and named Little Boy and Fat Man. They were created in 1942 by a predominantly male group of nuclear physicists, who were sequestered from their families in what has been called &lsquo;a cult of male solidarity&rsquo; at a remote site in New Mexico.2 The successful conception and delivery of Little Boy and Fat Man spawned not only a global industry in nuclear armaments (to say nothing of the subsequent deaths and devastation of various human and ecological communities), but exacerbated the masculinist, hyper-sexualization of warfare which had long correlated the power of the penis with the imposition of order in the world. It is no coincidence that, in mocking the size of Kim Jong-un&rsquo;s nuclear button, Donald Trump also characterized the world of North Korea as thoroughly disordered, paralleling the &lsquo;depleted and food starved regime&rsquo; with the nuclear impotency of its ruler. Like so many military leaders of the modern world, the gods of ancient south-west Asian societies also correlated the scale and impact of their weaponry with the size and virility of their penises. Bows, swords, clubs and spears were all common phallic symbols, and represented a certain form of alpha masculinity in which the aggression, bloodlust, dexterity, stamina and physical strength of a warrior were aligned with a rock-hard erection, powerful jets of semen, a heightened sexual prowess, an insatiable libido and penetrative domination. Of all weapons, the bow was particularly prized as the idealized phallus. In action, it mimicked the erect, ejaculating penis: drawing back the string stretched the bow into a powerful state of tension, akin to a stiffened penis close to orgasm; the explosive release of tension shot the arrow fast and far, like a projectile spurt of semen, penetrating deep into the body of its target. As a highly skilled warrior, the human bowman himself was the embodiment of a devastating sexualized masculinity. Rather than bludgeoning or hacking at an opponent with a club or a sword in exhausting hand-to-hand combat, he fought from a fixed, erect position on his feet or up on his knees; divinely blessed with precision timing, muscular agility, swiftness of movement and deft fingers, he exhibited the enviable ability to bring down the enemy from afar &ndash; again and again, without flagging. The phallic bow was naturally the weapon of choice for the gods. In the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish, the great warrior god Marduk, patron of the city of Babylon, takes on Tiamat, the goddess embodying the primordial salt-sea, with &lsquo;his great weapon&rsquo; &ndash; a huge, tightly strung bow called &lsquo;Deluge&rsquo;, a name playing on the storms and rains with which male warrior gods were so often associated. Tiamat&rsquo;s body shapeshifts throughout the myth, from primeval amniotic sac, to warrior woman, to scaly sea dragon, manifesting not only the uncontainable forces of disorder, but the misogynistic tendencies of Babylon&rsquo;s mythmakers themselves. &lsquo;No matter how great a woman&rsquo;s strength, it is no match for a man&rsquo;, the other gods remind Marduk as he prepares to take her on. Tiamat&rsquo;s body quivers and quakes with a mixture of sexual anticipation and fear for her life as Marduk approaches on his mighty chariot, his enormous weapon raised in his hand. Forcing open her mouth with a stormy wind, Marduk shoots an arrow from Deluge deep into her throat. The arrow impales her insides, ripping her innards and piercing her heart. The sexual violence of the myth was not lost on Babylon&rsquo;s priests and scribes, who abbreviated its plot with pithy references to &lsquo;Marduk, who defeated Tiamat with his penis&rsquo;.3 In vanquishing his fearsome foe, Marduk wins kingship over the gods, while Deluge, his penis-bow, is transformed into a celestial body and commemoratively suspended in the skies as a permanent sign, lest its power should ever be forgotten. The divine penis-bow has indeed been remembered &ndash; although not quite as Marduk might have expected. Instead, it is associated with Yahweh, the God of the Bible. He too is a warrior deity, whose signature weapons of thunderbolts, lightning strikes and torrential rains are equated with the devastating impact of his mighty bow and speeding arrows. Like Marduk&rsquo;s bow Deluge, Yahweh&rsquo;s bow is identified with his erect penis &ndash; albeit in the euphemistic language of bare flesh: &lsquo;You brandish your bow of nakedness! You satisfy the shafts of your bowstring!&rsquo; enthuses the prophet Habakkuk in his gloriously graphic vision of Yahweh as the ultimate phallic warrior.4 Throughout the Hebrew Bible, this is the god who is said to crush the genitals of his enemies so that they cannot &lsquo;rise up&rsquo; against him; his weapon is so intimidating that when he approaches, his enemies&rsquo; own bows slacken and droop, their penises sink and their genitals tremble.5 More horrifying is the sexualized nature of Yahweh&rsquo;s punishing assault on his own people. When he turns his bow on Jerusalem, it is cast as a vicious, humiliating attack by a hyper-masculine aggressor, as a poem in the sixth-century BCE book of Lamentations suggests: &lsquo;He bent his bow and set me as a target for his arrow; he shot into my organs with the arrows of his quiver . . . He made my teeth break on gravel, and made me cower in the dust&rsquo;.6 Of course, it is with his phallic bow that Yahweh &ndash; like Marduk &ndash; is said to have defeated the great sea monster, piercing its body to expose its innards.7 And he too appears to hang his bow in the skies: in the biblical story of the Flood, which incorporates motifs drawn from the battle with aqueous chaos, Yahweh memorializes his subjugation of the deadly waters by suspending his war bow in the heavens. &lsquo;My bow I have placed in the cloud&rsquo;, he declares. &lsquo;When I bring a cloud over the earth, and the bow appears in the cloud, I will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living being, so that waters shall not again become a flood to annihilate all flesh.&rsquo;8 The transformation of his war bow into a rainbow was made easy in biblical Hebrew, in which the word qeshet (&lsquo;bow&rsquo;) is used for both. But the phallic associations of this commemorative sky-sign were clearly recognizable to his worshippers: when the prophet Ezekiel beheld God&rsquo;s genitalia, he likened what he saw to the deity&rsquo;s phallic weapon of war, describing the glorious sight to be as dazzling as &lsquo;the bow in a cloud on a rainy day&rsquo;.9 The rainbow at which so many of us have looked in delighted wonder is a polychrome vision of God&rsquo;s weaponized penis. The divine penis inserted itself into the human world in other ways, too &ndash; not least on the battlefield. Across ancient south-west Asia, war was not simply a tool of economic and territorial conflict, nor solely a means of ordering the world and its inhabitants into the civilized and the barbaric, the victorious and the defeated. Warfare was idealized as a means of distinguishing the most masculine from the non-masculine. Like their gods, the south-west Asian kings of the second and first millennia BCE understood that the weapons of war represented their virility and masculinity &ndash; politically, socially and personally. Written into imperial treaties and international trade policies were divine curses to be triggered should one party renege on the agreed relationship: vassal kings would have their bows broken by the gods; their dynastic lines would be rendered sterile; their bodies would become impotent or effeminate. But just as it took more than a weapon to make a successful warrior, and more than a successful warrior to win a war, so it took more than a penis to make a man, and more than manliness to manifest masculinity. For gods and humans alike, this was a world governed and shaped by a network of multiple masculinities; each was relative, contextual and subject to the possibility of change. Aspects of these relative masculinities are well illustrated in the palace art of the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II (c. 883&ndash;859 BCE), now in the British Museum. Images of the king&rsquo;s military campaigns, detailed with jaw-dropping intricacy, are carved into vast stone wall panels which once decorated the rooms of his palace at Kalhu (later named Nimrud), in what is now Iraq. They are unflinching in their depiction of war: alongside row upon row of archers on foot and in chariots, severed heads, impaled corpses and skin-flayed bodies decorate the landscape. The dead are trampled underfoot; captives are led off in ropes and shackles; families are rounded up for deportation, their donkeys and ox-drawn carts packed high with bundles of food and clothing. Amid all these bodies, different forms of masculinity are plotted against the phallic symbol of the bow. On one panel, King Ashurnasirpal is in his chariot, charging towards a group of enemy bowmen (fig. 15). The speed of the attack is seen in the taut, lean bodies of the stallions, stretched into a gallop as they pull tight the thick reins held by the king&rsquo;s charioteer. Standing erect, his eyes fixed on his target, Ashurnasirpal draws back his bow, his arm muscles hardened into powerful curves. The fingers of his right hand are strong, long and slim, holding the end of the arrow shaft against the string. His left hand clasps the front of the bow, thumb raised and braced against the weapon&rsquo;s arch to guide the trajectory of the arrow balanced on his clenched fist. It is an exhibition of phallic hypermasculinity modelled and endorsed by Ashurnasirpal&rsquo;s god himself: in the skies above the king, set against his divine emblem, the Assyrian high god Ashur adopts the same position, pulling back his bow with muscular arms, his gaze trained on the enemy. The warring king and the warrior deity are as one. Fig. 15. A gypsum wall relief from the Northwest Palace in Kalhu (Nimrud), dated to about 865&ndash;860 BCE. It shows King Ashurnasirpal II in his chariot, charging through enemy lines as he wields his war bow. He mirrors his patron deity, the high god Ashur, who stretches back his bow in the heavens above him. By deliberate contrast, the bowmen targeted by Ashurnasirpal display a series of lesser masculinities. Although they too are fiercely mighty, they cannot compete with the aggressive virility of the king of Assyria. One aims his bow at the king, but its arch is weak, its string is limp, and his arms are bent and buckled. Another has lowered his bow altogether, its string positioned towards the king in a gesture of submission. The masculinity of a bowless man graphically declines further as he crawls on his hands and knees beneath the king&rsquo;s stallions, his buttocks raised towards the horses&rsquo; genitals, as if they too are about to penetrate him as demonstrably as the arrows embedded in his back. Finally, the lost masculinity of a fallen warrior is presented. He lies dead or dying on the battlefield, his left arm splayed out, his right arm slung across his waist, his hand drooping on his impotent groin, while an eagle pecks out his eyes.10 In all the battle scenes on Assyrian wall panels of this era, the soldiers of Assyria are vertically positioned, standing erect, or raised up high on their knees as they brandish their bows, dominating the space between the earth and the skies. Every Assyrian body is sharply dressed in a military tunic and hard with a powerful tension. The bodies of the defeated are very different. They may be appropriately muscular &ndash; as all warriors were expected to be &ndash; but they are corporeally diminished. Some are weaponless, some are shoeless, and some are entirely naked, stripped of all cultural viability. The dead litter landscapes, their limbs as emphatically limp as their exposed penises. They lie butchered on the ground, or are suspended from walls and poles, floppy and folded. Nowhere in these images is an Assyrian seen to be penetrated or at risk of penetration. Instead, it is the Assyrian who penetrates &ndash; with arrows, with spears, with knives, and with a divinely endorsed authority granted by the bow-bearing high god himself.11 To be a penetrated male was to be downgraded, degraded and devoid of masculinity. To be penetrated was not only to be emasculated &ndash; it was to be like a woman. Across ancient south-west Asia, high-status ideologies of warfare and politics usually ran parallel to cultural norms of sex, gender and sexuality. This was a patriarchal world in which social relationships tended to be structured on unequal terms, distinguishing between the penised and the non-penised, the penetrators and the penetrated, the dominant and the submissive, and the active and the passive. While the deliberate confusion of these distinctions was a prerogative of the gods, the human blurring of gendered and bodily hierarchies could generate considerable social anxiety. Even in the marital bedroom, the distinction between masculine dominance and feminine passivity was often carefully guarded. According to some Mesopotamian sources, a husband was not to allow his wife to be on top during sex, for fear it would rob him of his physical strength for a month. Centuries later, similar exhortations in the Babylonian Talmud would warn husbands that the same sexual position would curse them with diarrhoea.12 It was a fear of female sexual dominance further reflected in early medieval Jewish debates about the malevolent winged demon, Lilith. By then, some rabbis had recast this ancient Mesopotamian baby-killer as Adam&rsquo;s first errant wife, who had insisted on assuming the dominant position in sex because, she said, she and Adam were of equal status. When her husband refused, she sensibly abandoned the marriage, flying away over Eden&rsquo;s garden wall.13 If heterosexual relationships were potentially hazardous, same-sex relationships were especially problematic. While the masculinist focus of ancient south-west Asian literature tended not to notice sex between women, the phallic penetration of male bodies was a concern for some. The erotic dimensions of homosocial relationships were occasionally celebrated in myth and song &ndash; both Gilgamesh in Mesopotamia and King David in Judah were said to treasure the love of a man more than that of any woman. But more often than not, the sexual consummation of these relationships bordered on the taboo. In some social groups, gender constructs both shifted and intersected with status and power, so that sex between men was slightly less offensive if the penetrated partner was of a lower social category than his lover.14 But penetrative sex between men of the same social status was unacceptable, for it improperly feminized the receptive partner by diminishing his masculinity. In a text among a collection known as the Middle Assyrian Laws, dated to about 1225 BCE, the punishment threatened for this crime is retributive and severe: the perpetrator is to be raped and then castrated &ndash; &lsquo;feminizing&rsquo; him sexually, socially and physically.15 But the social impact of homoerotic sexual relationships was not restricted to the earthly realm &ndash; at least, not as far as some biblical writers were concerned. In the eyes of Yahweh, who had a special concern for the phallic productivity of his worshippers, sex between men could be particularly troublesome. The fertility of semen was best not wasted &ndash; whether on menstruating wives, other men&rsquo;s women, or male sexual partners. Consequently, the intrusion of the life-giving, semen-shooting penis into the barren, anal locus of &lsquo;dead&rsquo; faeces was considered a highly toxic impurity, remedied only by the community expulsion or execution of both partners.16 From the most masculine to the non-masculine, the penis was the pivot around which ideologies of cultural power turned, and the tool by which social order was calibrated. But it was not confined to war and sex alone. Phallocentric masculinity bound together many other aspects of ancient societies &ndash; and the undergirding patriarchal systems by which they were held to flourish. Most crucially, all life within the cosmos was usually understood to be drawn from and depend upon the phallic potency of the divine male. Cultural Insemination In 1760, an eminent Swiss physician called Samuel Auguste David Tissot published the revised and expanded results of his research into the dangers of male masturbation, entitled L&rsquo;Onanisme, ou dissertation physique sur les maladies produites par la masturbation. A runaway success, it was quickly translated into German, Italian and English, the expanded title of which rendered even more explicit the potential perils of a man&rsquo;s sexual selfsatisfaction: Onanism: or, a Treatise upon the Disorders Produced by Masturbation: or, The Dangerous Effects of Secret and Excessive Venery. 17 As an advisor to the Vatican, Tissot&rsquo;s work fortuitously offered scientific (for its time) condemnation of what Western Christianity regarded as a heinous activity, offensive to God: in the Bible, the deity had killed the unfortunate Onan for repeatedly spilling his seed (although in the story, the poor man&rsquo;s crime is not actually masturbation, but coitus interruptus).18 Tissot&rsquo;s manifesto against masturbation might have complemented Church teaching, but it undermined a belief long held in the West that semen might harbour dangerous &ndash; even devilish &ndash; powers. It was a view authoritatively endorsed by Augustine of Hippo, who centuries before had claimed that the sin of Adam and Eve was transmitted to every subsequent generation via &lsquo;corrupted semen&rsquo;.19 Instead, Tissot reasoned, semen was an unadulterated &lsquo;essential oil&rsquo;, more vital to the well-being of the male body than its blood: the loss of one ounce of semen, he asserted, was as hazardous as a blood loss of forty ounces. Excessive ejaculation was thus deadly. Worse still, it might strip a man of his humanity, reducing him to a monstrous non-human being, as Tissot&rsquo;s description of a compulsive masturbator suggests: I found a being that less resembled a living creature, than a corpse, lying upon straw, meagre, pale, and filthy, casting forth an infectious stench; almost incapable of motion, a watry palish blood issued from his nose; slaver constantly flowed from his mouth: having diarrhaea [sic], he voided his excrement into the bed without knowing it . . . he was a spectacle, the horrible sight of which cannot be conceived, and it was difficult to discover that he had formerly made part of the human species.20 Although it was widely regarded at the time as a seminal work of scientific research, Tissot&rsquo;s study was in many ways a product of much older ideas about the male body. His emphasis on the vitality of semen echoed the highly influential Greek view, shared by thinkers as divergent in their opinions as Hippocrates (c. 460&ndash;370 BCE) and Galen (c. 129&ndash;215 CE), that semen was the substance or transmitter of the &lsquo;vital force&rsquo; from which each human life derived and on which it survived, from the womb to the tomb. While Greek and later Western ideas about the reproductive capacities of a woman&rsquo;s &lsquo;seed&rsquo; or menstrual blood varied, semen was consistently understood as the agent of life: it sparked existence into being in utero, gifting the child its lifelong store of vitality, which had to be carefully managed lest it lingered too long, like rotting fruit, or spent out entirely, like a leaky trough. This masculinist conviction about the power of semen not only persisted well into the nineteenth century, but stretched back thousands of years, far beyond the golden age of Greek philosophical science, to the ancient cultures of south-west Asia. From the early third millennium BCE and well into the early centuries of the first millennium CE, there was at the very heart of these cultures a pervasive sense not only that semen was the source of new life, but that it was a substance so potent it was potentially dangerous. Whether divine, semi-divine, or human, semen could impact the materiality of the cosmos and its inhabitants in both enlivening and destructive ways. In social terms, the high cultural value of semen in ancient south-west Asia inevitably impacted the bodies and status of mortal women. Female bodies were held to shape, birth and nourish children, and their vulvas were considered organs of intense, intoxicating sexual allure. Yet generative power resided in the bodily fluids of men &ndash; especially their semen. &lsquo;Taken&rsquo; or &lsquo;received&rsquo; by the womb, semen acted as a clotting agent, curdling the blood residing passively inside the uterus into a fleshy child &ndash; an idea vividly illustrated in the Hebrew Bible when Job credits God with his conception: &lsquo;Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese? You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews&rsquo;.21 The powerful agency of semen is perhaps a notion embedded in the very earliest cuneiform texts (c. 3200 BCE), in which the ideogram (or symbol) for &lsquo;man&rsquo; appears to be an actively ejaculating penis, while &lsquo;woman&rsquo; is represented more passively by a pubic triangle.22 But it is also reflected in the distinctly gendered language of human sexual reproduction in subsequent ancient south-west Asian literatures &ndash; including the Hebrew Bible &ndash; in which men are usually said to &lsquo;beget&rsquo; children, while women simply &lsquo;bear&rsquo; them.23 Making babies was essentially a male activity &ndash; so much so, the penis was closely identified with the other most creative part of the male body: the hand. Both body parts were especially valued as agents of skilled, productive and transformative action. It is no surprise, then, to find that in many south-west Asian texts, the word &lsquo;hand&rsquo; was a common synonym of the penis. The work of one corresponded to the work of the other. And so it is in the Hebrew Bible, in which it is a man&rsquo;s divinely ordained task to bring life into the world by the work of his yad (&lsquo;hand&rsquo; or &lsquo;penis&rsquo;), whether it be impregnating a woman, keeping livestock, or tilling the land: &lsquo;Yahweh your god will make you abundantly prosperous in all the work of your hand/penis, in the fruit of your [woman&rsquo;s] womb, in the fruit of your cattle, and in the fruit of your soil.&rsquo;24 To a certain extent, the cultural privileging of the penis in these ancient societies is a stark reflection of the androcentric, elite perspectives of the scribes creating and compiling the texts on which we rely for information about the worlds in which they lived. This literature tended overwhelmingly to be produced by men, for men &ndash; and it was usually about men. But when complications in sex and reproduction arose, women were inevitably rendered more visible in the magical-medical rituals preserved in some scribal compositions, which indicate that women were expected to play a key role in helping to remedy penis problems &ndash; particularly in treating childlessness. Infertility was not widely considered an affliction suffered by men. Childlessness instead signalled &lsquo;barren&rsquo; wives. Men might experience impotence &ndash; a condition often caused by the malevolent powers of sorcery, demons, or the restless ghosts of jealous young virgins &ndash; yet their fertility was rarely in doubt. The penis might well remain disappointingly flaccid, but the semen held within the body was not believed to be seedless. Magical cures harnessed the fecund forces pervading the cosmos to empower the penis of any man proverbially described in Mesopotamian texts as one whose &lsquo;youthful masculinity has left [his] loins, like a runaway donkey&rsquo;.25 Some cures were probably quite effective in triggering an erection. In one Assyrian ritual, dated to about 1500 BCE, a woman is to take pulverized iron ore &ndash; the very stuff of hard weapons &ndash; mix it into oil and instruct her husband to rub it onto his penis, as she massages oil into her vulva. The ritual also recommends other restorative methods, such as talking dirty to him and encouraging him to envisage what (to all intents and purposes) looks to be bestial pornography: his wife tethers a stag to the head of the bed, and a ram at its foot &ndash; rutting animals with whom her husband is magically identified. Then, somewhat intimidatingly for her partner, she shouts a powerful incantation: The one at the head of my bed, get an erection, make love to me! The one at the foot of my bed, get an erection, make love to me! My vagina is the vagina of a bitch! His penis is the penis of a dog! As the vagina of a bitch holds fast the penis of a dog, [so may my vagina hold fast his penis!]26 As on earth, so in heaven. In myths across ancient south-west Asia, fertility was almost exclusively a masculine trait, exhibited by male deities. Sterility or barrenness in the world was not a manifestation of divine infertility &ndash; but nor was it a reflection of erectile dysfunction among the gods. Rather, it was a result of the deliberate withdrawal or absence of the masculine gods of fertility, who might retreat in response to insult or social disorder, or temporarily relocate to the wilderness or the underworld. The death and sterility their absences triggered starkly underscored their superior control of fecundity. It is a role evident in several traditions: when the Anatolian god Telipinu is suddenly angered, he puts his shoes on the wrong feet, storms out of the divine assembly and takes himself off into the wilderness. The impact is catastrophic: &lsquo;Barley and wheat no longer grow; cows, sheep, and humans no longer conceive, and those who are [already] pregnant do not give birth&rsquo;.27 Similarly, when the Ugaritic deity Baal is temporarily slain by the death god Mot, &lsquo;dried up are the furrows of the fields&rsquo;; it is only upon his resurrection from the underworld and return to the heavenly realm that &lsquo;the heavens rain down oil, the wadis run with honey&rsquo;.28 The calamitous impact of a disappearing deity is well known in the Bible, too. When God vows to punish his people with &lsquo;a miscarrying womb and dry breasts&rsquo;, he threatens to do so by abandoning them: [Israel&rsquo;s] Glory will fly away like a bird &ndash; no birth, no pregnancy, no conception! Even if they bring up children, I will bereave them until no one is left. Woe to them indeed when I depart!29 These myths overturn the common &ndash; and woefully reductive &ndash; misconception that across the ancient pantheons of south-west Asia, goddesses were primarily responsible for fertility. Instead, goddesses more usually looked after the womb, birth and lactation in matters of reproduction. But in the phallic cultures of this ancient world, they inevitably shared with their male peers a divine concern for the well-being and arousal of the human penis, and were frequently called upon to gift or empower the seductive, sexual allure of humans of all genders. Although female deities might well bring into being other deities, semi-divine heroes and humans, they often required both the assent and the semen, blood, tears, spit, sweat, or wet breath of divine masculinity to do so.30 By contrast, male deities could entirely forgo female cooperation, and create new life alone. In an ancient Egyptian myth, the high god Atum does precisely this when he masturbates the universe into existence. Ejaculating into his mouth, he spits and sneezes out his semen to create the male deity of airy space, Shu, and the female deity of sweet moisture, Tefnut: I am the one who acted as husband with my fist: I copulated with my hand, I let fall into my own mouth, I sneezed Shu and spat Tefnut.31 As Atum&rsquo;s hand acts as a wife&rsquo;s vagina, so his mouth and nostrils function as birth canals. His divine twins have sex and bring into being subsequent generations of sexually active deities, all of whom partner with a deity of the opposite sex to contribute to the further creation of the cosmos. Although the building of the universe relies on what we would recognize as heterosexual reproduction, the cosmos is initially stimulated into existence by Atum&rsquo;s powerful act of masturbation and auto-fellatio. Other male deities across the region might also ingest semen and carry pregnancies, but divine semen was so intensely fecund, it could pose a danger even to male gods themselves. In a Sumerian myth, the wellendowed deity Enki discovered this to his cost. Immensely proud of the generative power of his enormous penis, he takes to lurking in his marshlands, his erection &lsquo;sticking out&rsquo;, waiting for a young goddess to pass by so that he can impregnate her in what looks to modern eyes to be sexual coercion, if not rape. Having conceived and then coerced several generations of his own daughters in this way, his first victim Ninhursaga takes matters into her own hands. She wipes his semen from the genitals of his youngest daughter Uttu and sows it into the earth, cursing Enki to consume the plants that sprout from his seed. He becomes pregnant &ndash; and dangerously unwell, as severe pain grips his head, hair, nose, mouth, throat, arm, ribs and sides. Nonetheless, eight deities are successfully created from his own ingested semen.32 The physical ramifications of ingested semen and pregnancy for a male deity are also explored in Anatolian traditions of the late second millennium BCE, detailing the escapades of the rebellious Kumarbi, last seen pulling down the high god Anu from the heights of heaven and biting off his genitals. Having swallowed the god&rsquo;s penis and testicles, Kumarbi realizes three offspring are inside him. Like Egyptian Atum, he spits out two new deities. But the third remains within his body, rapidly growing into a formidable rival. Kumarbi understandably worries about how to birth him. It is an anxiety shared by his unborn son, the terrifying warrior god Tarhun, who is repulsed at the thought of emerging into the world via his father&rsquo;s rectum. It is only by smashing open his head against the cliffs of Mount Tassa that Kumarbi reluctantly enables the new god to break out of his body &ndash; a skull birth Zeus similarly experiences in delivering his warring daughter Athena.33 In all these myths, divine semen is so potent it can bring forth life even without a female body to gestate and birth it. And yet the stories about Enki and Kumarbi also warn against the potential dangers of divine selfprocreation. When motivated by hubris, it might result in catastrophic disorder: the parent&rsquo;s body might be damaged or diminished, or he might give birth to dangerous or rebellious progeny. For this reason, perhaps, the phallocentrism of self-procreation is often subverted by a telling emphasis on the machinations and interventions of goddesses. When Enki ingests his own semen-plants, it is because he has been tricked and cursed by Ninhursaga. The trauma his pregnancy inflicts on his body is only remedied when he is inserted into the vulva of the reconciliatory goddess, enabling him to birth his children from the safety of her vagina. Fortuitously, each one is a healing deity who cures Enki&rsquo;s afflicted body parts. When Kumarbi births his son from his smashed-in head, he must rely on the midwifery of the fate goddesses, who tend the wound and sew up his skull &ndash; perhaps alluding to the seams between the plates in the human cranium &ndash; and restore his body to wholeness. The thrust of these myths is a cautionary warning that, while male deities can indeed self-procreate, to bring new life into the world without female cooperation is risky. An ordered cosmos is a universe in which the ultra-potent semen of male deities is often best processed or managed by female bodies. It is a cultural caution the God of the Bible frequently ignores. Although he is best known in the West for using the body of a mortal woman to carry and birth his divine son, he is also presented as a god whose patriarchal masculinity is so extreme &ndash; and so intolerant of other deities and their generative powers &ndash; that he not only takes on the midwifery roles traditionally ascribed to goddesses, but repeatedly exhibits his own ability to bring new life into being by means of his own body. Given the sensitivities of the biblical writers, many of these stories have been stripped of their mythic features, screening the fertile body of God from direct view. But the texts nonetheless display his powers as the supreme divine progenitor. Best known, of course, is God&rsquo;s creation of the first human. In older but comparable Mesopotamian traditions, a mixed-gendered team of gods combines clay with the blood or semen of a deity to make humankind.34 But in Genesis, God emphatically acts alone: &lsquo;Yahweh-God formed a human [adam] from the dust of the ground [adamah], and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the human became a living being&rsquo;.35 Less well known, however, is God&rsquo;s use of his breath to create Lady Wisdom, the name biblical scholars give to the goddess figure known as Hokmah in Hebrew texts and Sophia in Greek-language Jewish texts. Popular from at least the fourth century BCE onwards, Lady Wisdom was said to have accompanied God at the creation of the world. In the secondcentury BCE book of Sirach (also known in Jewish tradition as Ben Sirah, and to Christians as Ecclesiasticus), she boasts of her privileged status and describes her birth from God&rsquo;s body: Fig. 16. The essential role of mother goddesses and birth goddesses is captured in this plaque from ancient Eshnunna, dated to about 1800 BCE. The deity cradles a newborn at her breast, while her divine attributes are represented by the infants emanating from her shoulders. The figures at her feet are variously interpreted as foetuses under her protection, or babies lost to miscarriage or stillbirth &ndash; threats warded off by the plaque itself. In the assembly of the Most High she opens her mouth, in the presence of his hosts she tells of her glory: &lsquo;I came forth from the mouth of the Most High, and covered the earth as a mist. I dwelt in the highest heavens, and my throne was in a pillar of cloud&rsquo;.36 Like the Egyptian god Atum, God not only creates a divine being identified with the moist air, but does so by expelling her from his mouth. And Lady Wisdom is not the only one to emerge from his body. In a much older poem incorporated into Deuteronomy (itself pre-dating Sirach by several centuries), God births a son called Jeshurun &ndash; a legendary figure subsequently identified with the great ancestor Jacob. The poem appears to reflect an ancient myth, repurposed to describe the Israelites&rsquo; turbulent relationship with their deity. Although only fragments of the myth appear in this complex composition, its gist is reasonably clear: God is presented in primeval form as the fertile &lsquo;Rock&rsquo;, a divine title alluding to the creative divine presence of both the cosmic mountain at the centre of the world and an unhewn standing stone in a cult place. He is called the &lsquo;father&rsquo; and &lsquo;progenitor&rsquo; of Jeshurun, whom he tends in the wilderness. In the barrenness of Jeshurun&rsquo;s desert home, God nurtures his child with the rich food of the gods, but Jeshurun exploits the nourishing love of his parent, growing &lsquo;fat, bloated and gorged&rsquo;. Eventually, he rebels against his father, abandoning him to honour instead other deities who had not birthed him. Rarely one to cope well with rejection, God is furious. In language explicitly highlighting his bodily conception and delivery of the child, he cries out, &lsquo;You were unmindful of Rock who bore you! You forgot God who gave birth to you!&rsquo;37 Within many modern Jewish and Christian communities, it has become spiritually comforting &ndash; if not socially strategic &ndash; to read into this biblical myth of the birthing, nurturing Rock a more inclusive, liberalized theology, by which the masculine God of the Bible is either rendered more palatably &lsquo;female&rsquo;, &lsquo;feminine&rsquo;, or &lsquo;maternal&rsquo;, or his powers of fertility are subsumed into bodiless, sexless, genderless abstraction. But this is to miss the point. The ability to self-procreate was a characteristic of the most powerful male gods &ndash; a graphic assertion of a potent hyper-masculinity, reflecting the widespread understanding that the divine male body (and the semen, spit, blood and moist breath it might produce) was the fertile source of all life in the cosmos. Like most deities, self-procreating gods were not constrained by the physiological limitations imposed on their human worshippers. Nor were they restricted to the more conventional gender roles associated with mortal bodies. As such, the self-procreative birthing of new life did not undermine the maleness of the God of the Bible. Instead, it amplified the fecund, unrivalled masculinity of God&rsquo;s body &ndash; a body onto which was mapped the status and value of mortal men&rsquo;s bodies, and their own phallic, seminal power. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.qjr74xm5uwj9"><span class="c4">Chapter 7</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0">PERFECTING THE PENIS </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When it was first exhibited in the early 1990s, the artist Jeff Koons&rsquo; &lsquo;Made in Heaven&rsquo; sparked a storm of controversy. Across a series of photographic canvases, technicolour sculptures and glass figurines, Koons and the artist and performer Ilona Staller (&lsquo;Cicciolina&rsquo;) were depicted engaging in a range of sex acts in scenes evoking a kitsch porn film. While the explicit sex unsettled some, the appropriation of religious themes discomforted others: some pieces mimicked images from the Sanskrit Kama Sutra, while others referenced the biblical story of Adam and Eve. Koons explained that &lsquo;Made in Heaven&rsquo; was a response to Masaccio&rsquo;s famous fresco in the Brancacci Chapel in Florence, showing the expulsion from the Garden of Eden, in which Adam and Eve&rsquo;s intense shame and anguish are heart-wrenchingly portrayed in their agonized facial expressions and body language. &lsquo;I was very moved by it,&rsquo; Koons said in an interview, and it prompted him to create what he described as &lsquo;a body of work that is kind of about after the Fall, but all of this guilt and shame is removed&rsquo;.1 Whether he succeeded or not is another matter. But his goal was particularly well illustrated in the exhibition by a large polychromed wooden sculpture called Jeff and Ilona (1990). It presents the couple as the new Adam and Eve, lying on a flowerstudded rock, around which is coiled a giant golden-scaled serpent. Dressed in diaphanous bridal lingerie, Ilona/Eve is arched on her back, her legs slightly parted, her arms above her head, her mouth open, her eyes closed. Jeff/Adam is naked, his body stretched out alongside hers, his stiffened penis against her thigh; raised up on his arms, he gazes down at Ilona/Eve, his facial expression caught somewhere between enchantment and voyeurism. Melding sex and religion into subversive form is nothing new. But Koons&rsquo; reinterpretation of the so-called &lsquo;Fall&rsquo; also offered a rare and important contribution to Western art: in his naked self-presentation as Adam, he seemingly (if inadvertently) rendered the first man circumcised. Given the concern with nudity and body-covering in the biblical story of Adam and Eve, the primeval couple&rsquo;s exposed genitalia have rarely been depicted in Jewish and Christian art across the ages. And in those unusual examples in which Adam&rsquo;s penis is shown (usually in European works), he appears to be equipped with a foreskin &ndash; reflecting the common assumption throughout the Christianized West that the newly created man came from the earth of Eden &lsquo;complete&rsquo;. But among Jewish communities, for whom male circumcision was divinely ordained, it had long been a more complex, serious matter. Did God create Adam circumcised or with a foreskin? The answer would reveal just as much about God&rsquo;s penis as it would about Adam&rsquo;s genitals. This ancient debate was prompted by the centrality of male circumcision to Jewish perceptions of the relationship between God and his people &ndash; an exclusive bond formalized in the Torah as a covenant and specifically idealized in God&rsquo;s commandment to the great ancestor, the righteous Abraham, in the book of Genesis: &lsquo;This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised. You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a mark of the covenant between me and you.&rsquo;2 In the biblical story of the religious past, the sign of the covenant is the circumcised penis. And Abraham is the first man to be circumcised. In this legend, it is said to be a ritual that marks him as tamim, &lsquo;whole&rsquo; or &lsquo;unblemished&rsquo;, and worthy to walk with God. But if circumcision marked the special covenantal relationship between God and man, the thought that Abraham&rsquo;s forebear Noah had been uncircumcised was perplexing. After all, he too had walked with God &ndash; the deity who had spared him from the Flood, and to whom he was similarly bound in a covenantal relationship.3 Beyond this, it was even more absurd that Adam, the very first man himself, whom God had made and blessed as the pinnacle of his creation, should have been denied the mark of circumcision. And yet, in the Hebrew Bible, neither Noah nor Adam is said to have forsaken his foreskin. As with many other theological conundrums, the problem was solved by careful rabbinic exposition of biblical texts. Noah, the rabbis declared in the second century CE, was clearly born circumcised, for he is described in Genesis as tamim, just like Abraham. But what of Adam? Crucially, the rabbinic answer to this question unveiled God&rsquo;s genitals in the starkest of ways: &lsquo;Adam, too, was born [from the earth] circumcised, for it is said, &ldquo;And God created man in his own image&rdquo; &rsquo;.4 If Adam was made in the image of God, as it is twice claimed in Genesis, he must have been circumcised, the rabbis reasoned, for God was circumcised, too. This idea is unlikely to have been an innovative theological shift. It reflects instead much older and deeply held assumptions. The elevated religious status of male circumcision in God&rsquo;s own sacred texts rendered it unthinkable that he could have had a foreskin. Culturally, too, there may have been an ancient mythic precedent for divine circumcision. God&rsquo;s direct forerunner, the Late Bronze Age deity El, appears to have undergone circumcision in a ritual preparing him for marriage and sex with the two goddesses he encountered at the seashore. In this Ugaritic myth, El sits enthroned, equipped with phallic symbols of old age and infertility: &lsquo;in his hand the staff of sterility; in his hand the staff of widowhood&rsquo;. El&rsquo;s reversal of the lifelessness held in his hands is revealed in a ritual asserting his sexual fecundity. His foreskin appears to be removed and the wound wrapped by ritual specialists associated with the careful cultivation of sacred vineyards: &lsquo;Those who prune the vine pruned him; those who bind the vine bound him; they let his tendril fall like a vine&rsquo;. Like a budding vine clipped into fruitfulness, so El&rsquo;s circumcised penis brings forth children in his new marriages &ndash; infant deities whose own genitalia (&lsquo;grapes&rsquo; and &lsquo;tendrils&rsquo;) are inspected by a birth goddess to ensure they are in order.5 The extent to which this myth was known throughout the Levant is uncertain. But in the Gospel of John (composed around 100 CE), the viticultural imagery of circumcision is used to describe Jesus as the &lsquo;true vine&rsquo;, who is &lsquo;pruned&rsquo; by his divine father to bring forth Christ&rsquo;s &lsquo;fruitful&rsquo; disciples.6 And as late as the fourth century CE, the Christian apologist Eusebius of Caesarea was citing an ancient writer called Philo of Byblos (c. 70&ndash;160 CE), who recounts an even older (if convoluted) Phoenician myth in which El circumcises himself before sacrificing his &lsquo;only begotten&rsquo; son, Iedoud (&lsquo;Beloved&rsquo;) &ndash; a story striking in its parallels to that of Abraham, who in Genesis similarly circumcises himself and then attempts to sacrifice his &lsquo;only begotten&rsquo; and &lsquo;beloved&rsquo; son Isaac.7 As a form of body modification, male circumcision was well known throughout the ancient world, although not all societies practised it. One of its earliest depictions appears in an ancient Egyptian tomb relief from Saqqara, the great necropolis of Memphis, and is dated to the period of the Sixth Dynasty (c. 2345&ndash;2181 BCE). Two naked young men each stand in front of a circumciser seated on the floor at his feet. With one hand, the circumciser gently pulls at the youth&rsquo;s flaccid penis; with the other, he carefully takes a tool to the tip of the penis. Annotations running across the relief present dialogues between the characters. &lsquo;Hold him fast; do not let him faint!&rsquo; says one circumciser to an attendant restraining one of the young men. &lsquo;I will do as you command&rsquo;, he responds. The other young man reaches out to place his hand on the head of his circumciser &ndash; perhaps to steady his nerves, as well as his gait. &lsquo;Sever, indeed, thoroughly&rsquo;, says the man. &lsquo;I will proceed carefully&rsquo;, replies his practitioner (fig. 17). While the precise purpose of circumcision in this relief goes unstated, accompanying hieroglyphs indicate the circumcisers are mortuary priests, initiating new members into their guild.8 As such, circumcision here appears to function as a body ritual manifesting a new social identity or religious status, enabling the circumcised to perform particular roles otherwise unavailable to them. Indeed, male circumcision in ancient or traditional societies tends to function in this way. Like other forms of religious body modification &ndash; including piercing, tattooing, scarification and cutting &ndash; male circumcision is a means of &lsquo;making&rsquo; the body. In contrast to the notion of the &lsquo;natural&rsquo; body as a body unchanged and unadorned, the peoples of ancient southwest Asia and Egypt perceived the body as an unfinished, ongoing social project, subject to essential alteration, adjustment and reformation. Temporary forms of body modification, including make-up, hair styling, clothing and ritual washing, as well as permanent alterations, helped &lsquo;make&rsquo; and &lsquo;remake&rsquo; the body in ways that materialized particular social identities and abilities.9 Fig. 17. This painted relief from the tomb of a royal official called Ankhmahor, in Saqqara, is widely held to depict circumcision. Dated to the Sixth Dynasty (c. 2345&ndash;2181 BCE), its accompanying inscriptions reveal that the circumcisers are mortuary priests. This form of body modification might have played a role in the initiation of new colleagues into their guild. This understanding of male circumcision stands in contrast to the common misperception that the reduction or removal of the foreskin reflected ancient efforts to maximize genital hygiene &ndash; a concern replicated in a number of Western societies today, particularly in the United States and Canada, where circumcision is routinely performed on infant males not as a religious ritual, but a medical convention. But there is little (if any) evidence to suggest that the ancient origins of circumcision lie with a concern about potential health risks festering beneath the foreskin. Blame for this tenacious misperception largely falls on the Greek writer Herodotus. Writing in the mid-fifth century BCE, he asserts that circumcision was originally a custom of the Egyptians, who &lsquo;practise circumcision for the sake of cleanliness, for they set cleanness above seemliness&rsquo;.10 But although Herodotus was famously declared the &lsquo;father of history&rsquo;, his travelogues turned instead on cultural caricature and parody. Consequently, his description of the Egyptian practice satirizes the &lsquo;clean&rsquo; nature of circumcision: to be &lsquo;clean&rsquo; was not to be hygienic, but to be a body ritually ready for presence or action in sacred space. This seems to be the context of circumcision in the Egyptian relief at Saqqara, and it is the way in which circumcision is presented in Genesis: when God instructs Abraham to circumcise himself and walk with him, the ritual is pitched as the modification necessary to render Abraham unblemished (tamim). And the reason why the God of the Bible would perceive the foreskin to be a blemish likely lies with the power of his own penis. In ancient and traditional societies, circumcision is more usually performed on pubescent or near-pubescent males as a rite of passage, marking on their bodies the maturing of their reproductive sexuality and the transition from boyhood to manhood. But the reduction or removal of the foreskin is more than a symbol of shifting social status. In societies in which a meaningful distinction is drawn between the mysterious hiddenness of the inside of the body, and the more visible, malleable aspects of its outside, rituals often serve to control or negotiate the interplay between the two. This is why social and religious regulations in traditional societies often accrue around the body&rsquo;s orifices. But the deliberate blurring of the distinction between the inside and the outside of the body is also powerfully transformative. Bringing the inside of the body &lsquo;out&rsquo; intensifies its social and religious force. In the religious imagination, traditional male circumcision falls into this category: it &lsquo;opens&rsquo; the penis, bringing the glans &lsquo;outside&rsquo; the body permanently (perhaps mimicking the exposure of the glans in an erection) and thereby enhancing the fertile potency of the penis. It is no wonder male circumcision was so central to ancient Judaism and its religious precursors. Just as God&rsquo;s penis manifested his life-giving powers, so too he rendered the penises of his male worshippers more fruitful in commanding circumcision. This is made explicit in his covenant with Abraham in Genesis: Yahweh promises to make Abraham &lsquo;the ancestor of a multitude&rsquo; by rendering him &lsquo;exceedingly fruitful&rsquo;11 &ndash; a prospect Abraham initially finds incredible, given that he is nearing one hundred years old, and his elderly wife, Sarah, has always been barren. But male circumcision is the means by which this covenantal blessing is to be brought about, miraculously gifting Abraham and Sarah not only with a son of their own, Isaac, but with generations of Abrahamic descendants, tracked in Jewish tradition via the newborn Isaac, rather than Ishmael, the patriarch&rsquo;s thirteen-year-old son born by the slave-girl Hagar, who in the Bible is quickly rejected by his father after Isaac&rsquo;s birth. It is for this reason that the heightened fruitfulness of the circumcised penis is closely associated in the Hebrew Bible with the careful cultivation of agricultural fecundity. Maturing fruit trees are held to render a better quality and more bountiful crop if &lsquo;circumcised&rsquo; in their fourth year &ndash; much as El&rsquo;s circumcised penis was made fruitful by those who &lsquo;prune the vine&rsquo; at Ugarit.12 But the close paralleling of circumcised penises and fruiting trees also carries a more unsettling legacy, as the Phoenician myth of El&rsquo;s circumcision appears to have done. Just as the God of the Bible demanded his cut of the agricultural and animal harvest in the form of tithed offerings in his temples, so too he claimed his ancient right to a cut of the human crop: &lsquo;The firstborn of your sons you shall give to me. You shall do the same with your oxen and your sheep. Seven days he shall remain with his mother; on the eighth day you shall give him to me.&rsquo;13 But while a firstborn animal was to be sacrificed, male infants were to be &lsquo;rescued&rsquo; from death by means of circumcision &ndash; the modification of their penises physically marking God&rsquo;s claim to their bodies. Male circumcision not only brought life, but protected newborn males from sacrificial death, transforming a fertility ritual more usually performed on pubescent boys into a birth ritual.14 Such was the religious power of the circumcised penis that, by the fifth century BCE, the priests of the Jerusalem temple had developed a complex set of regulations designed to tame its seminal discharge: its potent fertility should only be used to bring &lsquo;legitimate&rsquo; life into the world. Sex outside marriage was discouraged. Sex with a kinsman&rsquo;s woman (whether wife, sister, mother, or daughter) was abhorrent because it risked confusing patrimonial bloodlines. Sex with a &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; woman, who might well worship other gods, risked destabilizing the kinship cohesion of Yahweh&rsquo;s worshippers, and undermined his exclusive claim to their children. And as we have seen, sexually penetrating another man, or an animal, or ejaculating onto the earth, was especially deviant &ndash; not for any clear moral objections, but probably because it meant that semen would be wasted, transgressing God&rsquo;s command that his people were to &lsquo;be fruitful and multiply&rsquo;.15 Enshrined in the Torah, these religious regulations were originally intended only for priests, but they would increasingly be assumed to apply to all male Yahweh worshippers in and beyond the Jerusalem temple. In an ancient society in which idealized masculinity was closely tied to the social and physiological performance of the penis, Jerusalem&rsquo;s religious elites considered the uncircumcised penis deficient &ndash; just as other body parts that did not function optimally (deaf ears, mumbling mouths, disloyal hearts) were also said to be &lsquo;uncircumcised&rsquo;.16 And if the uncircumcised penis was deficient, so too was its owner. He was perceived as physically, socially and religiously defective, which is why some biblical writers are emphatic in their insistence that only the circumcised can participate in rituals devoted to Yahweh and count themselves among the people of God. This ideology would later go some way to constructing a distinctively masculinized &lsquo;ethnic&rsquo; identity of Yahweh worshippers within early Jewish societies. But its phallocentrism rendered those without functioning genitals or a penis to circumcise excluded from certain forms of worship, and either temporarily or permanently marginalized in their communities: women and alternatively gendered members of society, including those conventionally described as &lsquo;eunuchs&rsquo; and the genitally impaired, were increasingly seen as inherently flawed &ndash; and potentially destabilizing in the religious world.17 Consequently, these lesser bodies demanded careful management, primarily &ndash; but not exclusively &ndash; by means of rituals understood to contain or counteract the social and religious dangers they manifested. Eunuchs had long enjoyed or endured a unique status across ancient south-west Asia. Their specialized bodies rendered them powerfully equipped not only to cross boundaries between masculine and feminine spaces, but to traverse the ritualized thresholds of the cosmos, so that they might step safely between divine and human spheres. And yet their mysterious liminality made them potentially dangerous, and they were feared and celebrated in equal measure. Among the masses, their fates were precarious. But within elite contexts, some eunuchs might be elevated to prestigious political and religious positions. Some were identified as eunuchs from birth, but many were castrated males &ndash; some voluntarily, some through coercion or force. If they survived castration, the resulting health complications made their lives expensive to sustain, rendering them luxury commodities and status symbols for their wealthy patrons or owners. Eunuchs literally embodied designer chic for royal courts and temples.18 It is in these elite settings that eunuchs most frequently appear in the Hebrew Bible: they are members of royal households, performing important political, military and religious roles. But in Judah, their lives changed in the fifth century BCE, when the Persian Empire held sway across the region. Judah&rsquo;s defunct monarchy was replaced by a series of imperially appointed governors, who oversaw the rebuilding of Jerusalem&rsquo;s temple. Its priesthood was reconstituted, and the city&rsquo;s burgeoning theocracy now ministered to a much-reduced community. Against this backdrop, eunuchs&rsquo; bodies became more problematic. Although most were equipped with a penis (and some were able to have penetrative sex), their sterility rendered them &lsquo;a dry tree&rsquo; in a religious culture in which the fruitful phallus was ever more crucial. They were to be kept away from God&rsquo;s presence, although one of Yahweh&rsquo;s prophets promised they would be granted compensatory access to sacred space in the form of a memorial stela, which would be pointedly erected in the temple and would be &lsquo;better than sons and daughters&rsquo;.19 For those members of society without a penis, matters of templecommunity membership were more complex, for their bodies deviated even further from the religious ideal of the circumcised male. Female circumcision appears not to have been a practice with which ancient southwest Asian and eastern Mediterranean societies were particularly familiar. Early evidence for the rite anywhere in this region is sporadic and sketchy at best, and tends to be filtered through the pejorative cultural bias of Greek and Roman writers primarily discussing &lsquo;exotic&rsquo; Egyptian communities.20 Instead, Jerusalem&rsquo;s priests formalized the older tendency to restrict or exclude women from the male-dominated spaces and rituals of the temple, and countered the dangerous impact of their &lsquo;leaky&rsquo; bodies by prohibiting men from having sex with a menstruating woman.21 They also guarded male infants from the contaminating impact of their own &lsquo;female&rsquo; birth blood. Mothers and babies were to be considered &lsquo;unclean&rsquo; and kept away from both sacred space and those men who might enter it, until their uncleanness had subsided and they had performed the requisite purification rituals. If a woman bore a son, the blood of his circumcision on the eighth day countered the dangerous blood of his mother&rsquo;s body; the baby boy was made &lsquo;clean&rsquo;, while she remained in a state of impurity for thirty-three days. If she birthed a daughter, however, a mother&rsquo;s uncleanness was intensified: her body was highly toxic for fourteen days, and she remained impure for a further sixty-six days.22 Essentially, the Hebrew Bible was born in a specialized scribal culture in which the circumcised penis was both the ultimate human manifestation of a divinely endorsed, phallocentric masculinity and a bodily performance of &lsquo;normative&rsquo; faithful devotion to God. This speaks to a hierarchy of human bodies, built on relative and varying constructions of gender (including diverse shades of masculinities), deeply embedded within the religious traditions giving rise to early Judaism and Christianity. At the apex of this hierarchy was the circumcised male body, a body itself drawn on a divine paradigm: the body of God. As the cosmic creator, who constructed human males in his own image, it was for many beyond theological doubt that God himself was circumcised, and that this form of body modification among his male worshippers perfected their own penises, making their bodies whole, unblemished and divinely fertile, as it had Abraham. Manhood The paradigmatic divine penis inevitably extended into Christianity and onto the body of Jesus of Nazareth. Oddly, though, his is a body about which we know very little. For all its talk about Jesus, one of the most peculiar features of the New Testament is its apparent disinterest in what he looked like.23 Certainly, the writers of these texts offer various observations about the wounds inflicted on Jesus during his torture and execution, and the nature of his resurrected body. But nowhere in the biblical canon is there a description of his physical features. Only one passing detail about the visual appearance of his body is given: Jesus&rsquo; penis was circumcised.24 This in itself should come as no surprise. After all, Christianity began as a minor Jewish sect. Jesus of Nazareth was Jewish, as were most of his first followers. It was only natural that Jesus was assumed to have been circumcised. But the presumed religious realities of Jesus&rsquo; personal life were all too often lost in the highly abstract theologies of Paul and other early Christian leaders, for whom the resurrected, heavenly Christ was in many ways more important than Jesus the man. To a certain extent, the authors of the New Testament Gospels (composed after Paul&rsquo;s letters) tempered this abstraction by focusing on the earthly, human nature of Christ, offering tales of Jesus&rsquo; life set in his own Jewish culture in Roman Palestine. But these tales also served to bolster first-century Christian theologies; as a subset of Judaism, earliest Christianity necessarily relied upon the Jewish scriptures to endorse its claims about Jesus&rsquo; messianic and divine status. Consequently, selected Jewish cultural and religious preferences are used in the Gospel accounts of the mysterious man from Nazareth to attest to his bona fide credentials as the alleged embodiment and &lsquo;fulfilment&rsquo; of both traditional Jewish teaching and practice. And for some early Christians, there was no denying that this divine man&rsquo;s penis was appropriately circumcised. Authoritative confirmation was offered in the Gospel of Luke, in which Jesus is said to have been circumcised on his eighth day of life, in accordance with God&rsquo;s regulations in the Torah. Afterwards, when both he and his mother have emerged from the impurity of the birth, Jesus is taken to the Jerusalem temple to be presented to God, because &ndash; as the author of Luke states &ndash; &lsquo;it is written in the law [Torah] of the Lord, &ldquo;Every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the Lord&rdquo; &rsquo;.25 In this early Christian tradition, at least, Jesus&rsquo; circumcision functions in expected ways: it brings Jesus&rsquo; body into anatomical line with the masculine, circumcised body of the god of the Jerusalem temple. But the sexualized fecundity promised by male circumcision would not bear fruit in the New Testament; both the earthly Jesus of Nazareth and the risen, heavenly Christ remain emphatically childless and celibate. Instead, the fruits of his circumcised penis are spiritualized. In the Gospel of John, as we have seen, they are disciples &lsquo;pruned&rsquo; from his &lsquo;vine&rsquo; by his divine father. Meanwhile, in the letter to the Colossians, Christ&rsquo;s circumcision figuratively de-fleshes the base bodies of his followers, transforming them into spiritually charged believers destined for eternal life: &lsquo;In him also you were circumcised with a spiritual circumcision, by putting off the body of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ . . . And when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with him&rsquo;.26 The spiritualizing of circumcision was not only theologically fruitful, but socially strategic. In its early years, the Jesus movement was exhibiting the symptoms of an older cultural malaise suffered by its Jewish parent: circumcision had become a problem. Evidence from as early as the second century BCE indicates that some Jewish men within and beyond Judaea (Judah) were attempting to conceal or reverse their circumcisions. Traces of this practice are evident in 1 Maccabees (late second century BCE), in which a group of Jewish elites is roundly condemned for building a Greek gymnasium in Jerusalem and &lsquo;removing the marks of circumcision&rsquo; before exercising in the nude. It was an event similarly condemned by the historian Josephus &ndash; a Jewish Roman &ndash; who claims that the men of Jerusalem&rsquo;s gymnasium &lsquo;concealed the circumcision of their private parts in order to be Greeks even when unclothed&rsquo;.27 But Greek-style sporting etiquette was not the only motivation for the practice. It might also be triggered by religious &lsquo;conversion&rsquo;. Just as Gentile men across the Mediterranean were often circumcised when they joined diasporic Jewish communities, so those abandoning their traditional Jewish practices for Graeco-Roman gods or Christian worship might seek &lsquo;uncircumcision&rsquo;. This is powerfully presented in the New Testament writings of Paul, in which he advises Jewish followers of Christ against &lsquo;epispasm&rsquo; &ndash; the physical reversal of circumcision: &lsquo;Was anyone at the time of his call circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call foreskinned? Let him not seek circumcision.&rsquo;28 As a circumcised Jewish convert to Christ, Paul himself may well have found the prospect of secondary genital modification unappealing. Although he gives no indication of precisely how Jewish men were reversing their circumcisions, other ancient sources suggest it could be achieved in two ways. The easiest method was a temporary (and faintly implausible) fix: circumcision might be camouflaged by donning a sheath. But for those requiring a longer-lasting solution, the process was more complex &ndash; and uncomfortable. Weights were attached to the skin at the neck of the penis shaft, piercing any residual remnants of the foreskin, so that it was stretched over the glans to cover as much of the head of the penis as possible. It is described in early rabbinic traditions as meshikhat orlah (&lsquo;drawing down the foreskin&rsquo;), and appears to have been sufficiently notorious that it rarely required further explanation. But it concerned Jewish leaders enough to institute a lasting change in traditional circumcision. By the mid-second century CE, rabbis were instructing circumcisers in their communities not only to cut back the bulk of the foreskin, but to split and peel away the underlying mucous membrane, which fully exposed the corona and prevented the stretching of vestigial skin over the glans. Known as periah (&lsquo;revealing&rsquo;), it remains the standard method of traditional Jewish circumcision.29 The physical removal or reversal of male circumcision had more to do with wider Graeco-Roman constructs of idealized masculinity than intraJewish religious resistance; for the Greek intelligentsia and their Roman beneficiaries, the perfect male body was the muscular nude form of the athlete &ndash; a corporeal manifestation of disciplined masculine beauty teasingly caricatured in Aristophanes&rsquo; Clouds as &lsquo;a rippling chest, radiant skin, broad shoulders, a wee tongue, a grand rump and a petite dick&rsquo;. Crucially, the penis was to be generously foreskinned, and the testicles present and intact.30 While circumcised men and various types of eunuchs were well known in the Greek and Roman worlds, their modified genitals often signalled an &lsquo;exotic&rsquo; or discomforting cultural otherness &ndash; no matter how &lsquo;Greek&rsquo; or &lsquo;Roman&rsquo; they were in any other way. Within this context, both male circumcision and castration tended to be perceived as a barbaric &lsquo;mutilation&rsquo;, potentially generating transgressive or uncontrolled sexual appetites. The two forms of genital modification were only marginally distinguished in the second century CE, when forced castration was increasingly outlawed, and the lucrative trade in congenital and voluntary eunuchs was subjected to tighter regulation in the Roman Empire.31 Against this backdrop, male circumcision was an inflammatory issue in some Christian communities, as New Testament texts suggest. This literature was written and shared by Greek-speaking Christians thoroughly immersed in their own Graeco-Roman cultures &ndash; many of whom were growing increasingly hostile to the Jewish origins of their faith. Eventually, most forms of Christianity would abandon circumcision altogether &ndash; a position encouraged by Paul&rsquo;s letter to the Galatians, in which he claims that Christians are rendered the offspring of Abraham not by means of the body, but by their faith in Christ: &lsquo;There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham&rsquo;s seed, heirs according to the [covenant] promise.&rsquo;32 Some Christians today often interpret his words as a more &lsquo;democratized&rsquo; (and even superior) understanding of the traditional Jewish idea of covenant &ndash; a theological liberation from what they perceive to be the restrictive gender politics and ethnocentrism of Judaism. But this is mistaken. Paul was not rejecting circumcision, nor the validity of the Torah in which it was so keenly promoted; nor was he calling for the emancipation of slaves, nor indeed for the elevation of women to a status equal to men (foreskinned or not). Rather, Paul was asserting that even the starkest of social distinctions were eclipsed by believers&rsquo; shared identity &lsquo;in Christ Jesus&rsquo;. For this reason, he repeatedly argued, there was no need for people to seek a change in their social or cultural positioning &ndash; hence his insistence that within a Christian community in which cultural descent of members varied, Gentile genitals should not be cut, while Jewish genitals could continue to be. &lsquo;Let each of you lead the life that the Lord has assigned, to which God called you&rsquo;, he wrote. &lsquo;This is my rule in all the churches&rsquo;.33 Ultimately, neither circumcision nor non-circumcision mattered to Paul, for penises were about to become redundant. With the imminent coming of the Kingdom of God, there would be no need for mortal bodies and no need for sex. Instead, Christians would be returned to the celibate, celestial state in which &ndash; they had come to believe &ndash; humans were originally created.34 But Christian theology has never been wholly successful at reconciling its heavenly aspirations with the material, bodily realities of human existence. Paul&rsquo;s lofty theology not only failed to quell early Christian disputes about the religious significance of circumcised penises, but it also did little to diminish a growing appetite for any fleshy fragments Christ might have left behind before his ascension to heaven. By the fourth century CE, believers had grown increasingly interested in Jesus&rsquo; own circumcision &ndash; and the fate of his foreskin. In a world in which the mortal remains of holy men and heroes were already venerated in Jewish and Graeco-Roman cultures, the purported material fragments of Jesus&rsquo; earthly life &ndash; from the splinters of his cross to his bloodied death shroud &ndash; were naturally believed to hold magical powers. A trade in holy relics spread across Christendom, encouraged by legends assuring believers that bits of Christ&rsquo;s body remained in the world. Proof of the continued existence of Jesus&rsquo; foreskin was firmly attested in the so-called Arabic Infancy Gospel (c. fifth century CE), an influential text drawing on colourful traditions circulating about Christ&rsquo;s early life. It includes the story of a midwife present at the birth and circumcision of Jesus, who sagaciously stores his severed foreskin in an alabaster container of precious oil and gives it to her pharmacist son &ndash; a purveyor of powerful potions and lotions. Although she instructs him not to sell it, it is procured by the &lsquo;sinful&rsquo; woman who anoints Jesus&rsquo; feet when he is an adult &ndash; a canny detail reassuring concerned Christians that the oil touching Jesus&rsquo; body had already been sanctified by the presence of his holy foreskin within it.35 The text neglects to tell its readers what subsequently became of Christ&rsquo;s foreskin &ndash; but no matter, for it began to pop up with astonishing frequency across the Christian world. East and West, increasing numbers of churches, bishops, mystics and pilgrims all claimed to be in possession of what would come to be known as the Holy Prepuce. By the thirteenth century, the most famous of Christ&rsquo;s foreskins was believed to be lodged in Rome. It was claimed that a heavenly hand had presented it to Charlemagne (c. 742&ndash;814 CE) as he prayed in Jerusalem&rsquo;s Holy Sepulchre while on pilgrimage. He had taken it to Western Europe, enshrining it first in his imperial chapel at Aix-la-Chapelle (now Aachen, in Germany), and then at Charroux, in France, before gifting it to Pope Leo III in return for his coronation as the first Holy Roman Emperor, on Christmas Day 800 CE. Leo is said to have kept it in a sacred chest of cypress wood along with other earthly remains of Christ&rsquo;s body &ndash; including his umbilical cord and death blood.36 When Rome was sacked in 1527, during the wars of Pope Clement VII and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, the Holy Prepuce disappeared &ndash; although this did not prevent its continued appearance in countless churches throughout Christendom. It was last seen in 1983, in the small Italian town of Calcata, where it had apparently been venerated for centuries. And yet, shortly before its ritual exhibition at its annual festival, it again disappeared. The local priest claimed sacrilegious thieves had ransacked his home, stealing the shoebox at the back of his wardrobe in which the holy relic resided for safekeeping. But many believed it was snatched by dark forces within the Vatican.37 For centuries, paying pilgrims had flocked to see the Holy Prepuce at sacred sites across medieval Europe, seemingly unconcerned by its mysterious ability to be installed in several places at the same time. After all, said some, it was further proof of the miraculous ability of Jesus&rsquo; body to regenerate and multiply without diminishing in power &ndash; a phenomenon attested by the repeated consumption of Christ&rsquo;s flesh and blood in the Eucharist. Others, however, had long suspected it was evidence of a racket in relics. To counter forgers and sceptics &ndash; and no doubt boost church coffers &ndash; the authenticity of a Holy Prepuce might be certified by reputable Christian mystics, whose visionary encounters with the divine enabled them to furnish cathedrals and churches with curatorial notes on their relics. But validation might also be sought by means of the taste test: a physician would be appointed by local clergy to nibble a piece of the latest relic to confirm whether it was vegetal matter, animal leather, or human foreskin.38 Its sanctity might also be confirmed by its flavour. Sacred relics were believed to give off a sweet scent; they surely tasted sweet, too. This was indeed the experience of the thirteenth-century Beguine mystic Agnes Blannbekin, who claimed Christ&rsquo;s foreskin tasted gloriously sweet. Agnes was regularly swallowing the Holy Prepuce, which miraculously manifested itself on her tongue when she received Communion on the annual Feast of the Circumcision. She reported its consistency was &lsquo;alike the skin in an egg&rsquo;, and that, when she felt compelled to put her finger in her mouth to touch it, &lsquo;that little skin went down her throat on its own&rsquo;, filling her limbs with a sweetness so great it appears to have triggered an orgasmic out-ofbody experience.39 Intimate encounters with the Holy Prepuce often took on an erotic, fetishistic allure. In the fourteenth century, Christ&rsquo;s foreskin wrapped itself around the finger of Catherine of Siena &ndash; an unenclosed nun and mystic, who believed she had been wedded to Christ in a vision. This in itself was not altogether unusual. Catherine shared with many other celibate devotees an understanding that her intensely intimate relationship with Christ was a sacred marriage. But for Catherine, that marriage was marked by the Holy Prepuce she saw encircling her finger like a wedding band. &lsquo;You espouse our souls to you with the ring of your flesh&rsquo;, she declared in a passionate prayer to her divine husband.40 Catherine was a great letter-writer, and repeatedly reminded other brides of Christ in her correspondence that &lsquo;we do not marry Christ with rings of gold or silver but with the ring of Christ&rsquo;s foreskin, given in the circumcision and accompanied by pain and the shedding of blood&rsquo;.41 For both Agnes Blannbekin and Catherine of Siena, as for other Christian thinkers, the bloodied foreskin was not only a treasured earthly remnant of the divine body, but a material manifestation of the transformative, salvific death of Christ: cast as the first painful wound inflicted on his innocent body, Jesus&rsquo; circumcision anticipated the piercing of his hands and feet, and the lancing of his side, as he died in agony upon the cross. But the mystical, erotic experiences of these pious women also reflect a deep and devout desire to encounter the corporeal realities of Christ upon and within their own bodies. Like those priests and pilgrims who venerated the Holy Prepuce, Agnes and Catherine sought to enflesh the religious realities of their convictions in ways the more doctrinal, immaterial abstractions of Christian theology and its transcendent, otherworldly God could not. It was not only relics that helped to perpetuate the vernacular engagement with Christ&rsquo;s fleshy genitals in the West. The circumcision of the infant Jesus became a stock feature of art across medieval and Renaissance Europe. But the visual portrayal of the cleansing cut of his Jewish past was heavily influenced by its common reinterpretation as a precursor to his Passion. Blended with the virulent antisemitism of the West, artistic representations of Christ&rsquo;s circumcision often portrayed a chubby white baby Jesus as the self-sacrificing victim of the bloodthirsty, hooked-nosed Jewish circumcisers surrounding him. Frequently garbed in the imagined vestments of the ancient Jewish priesthood, or topped with the distinctive peaked hat that had become a conventional, malevolent marker of &lsquo;Jewishness&rsquo; in European art, these men are regularly depicted crowding around the child, leering at the large blade menacingly positioned at his tiny genitals.42 In some works, the ugly caricaturing of Jewish ritual was further embellished by the deliberate mis-gendering of the circumciser as a hideous, villainous woman. In the masculinist world of medieval and Renaissance Christianity, circumcision was still closely associated with castration. The Jewish &lsquo;mutilation&rsquo; of the genitals was therefore cast as a feminizing, sexually abusive wound, fating little boys to an unmanned adulthood.43 One example among many powerfully illustrates this: a depiction of Jesus&rsquo; circumcision in Guillaume de Digulleville&rsquo;s widely read trilogy, The Pilgrimage of Human Life, the Pilgrimage of the Soul and the Pilgrimage of Jesus Christ (c. 1400), shows a startled infant Jesus raising his arm in an attempt to fend off the snarling woman looming over his genitals. Two other Jewish women huddle behind her, craning their necks to see the cut. By contrast, Jesus&rsquo; parents stand at a distance behind him, Mary&rsquo;s hands raised in fretful, pleading protest (fig. 18). Mary&rsquo;s maternal concern for Jesus&rsquo; penis was even more familiar in the wildly popular representations of the Madonna and child, in which the naked infant was depicted sitting in her lap, her hand or fingers modestly covering his genitals. But in several Renaissance examples of this scene, Mary&rsquo;s hand does not veil his penis. Instead, she gestures towards it, holds it between her fingers, or gently fondles it in ways indicative of its very deliberate public exhibition. In some instances, the child&rsquo;s penis appears to serve as an object of veneration to other figures in the composition, who gaze upon it in pious, wondrous adoration.44 The Madonna&rsquo;s emphatic exhibition of Jesus&rsquo; genitals not only serves to underscore his fleshy humanity, but foregrounds the mediatory role of the divine penis in Christ&rsquo;s relationship with the world. Fig. 18. Antisemitic motifs abound in this portrayal of Christ&rsquo;s circumcision, featured in an illustrated version of Guillaume de Digulleville&rsquo;s Pilgrimage trilogy (c. 1400 CE). In particular, the ritual is presented as a cruel and barbaric custom as the circumciser &ndash; deliberately misrepresented as a woman &ndash; takes a huge pair of shears to the infant&rsquo;s tiny genitals. Mary&rsquo;s assertive exposure of her son&rsquo;s penis is often met with his responsive approval in paintings employing what art historian Leo Steinberg affectionately calls the &lsquo;chin-chuck&rsquo;: as the Madonna presents Jesus&rsquo; genitals, the Christ child reaches out his little arm and touches his mother&rsquo;s chin. It is a much older artistic motif of erotic endorsement, adapted in medieval Christian art to communicate the complex theological intimacy of Christ and the Virgin: she is not only his mother, but his chosen heavenly consort. The celibacy of their union tempers the genital sexualization of Christ in these images.45 But this is disrupted in certain Renaissance portrayals of the piet&agrave; &ndash; another stock scene in Western Christian iconography, mirroring with forceful intent the intimacy of the Madonna and child. In these images, Christ is again held in the Virgin&rsquo;s lap, but this time he is the sexually mature man who has been killed and brought down from the cross. In anguish, his mother cradles his naked, broken body, his groin strategically covered by his dead hand or draped with fabric. But in some versions of the piet&agrave;, Christ&rsquo;s penis is startlingly erect beneath his loincloth. A vivid example is an early-sixteenth-century painting attributed to the Flemish artist Willem Key. A bearded, muscular Christ lies dead across his mother&rsquo;s lap, his hand pierced with the gaping wound of a nail. A heavily veiled Mary lifts his head to her own as she bends to kiss his lips. Christ&rsquo;s pelvic and thigh muscles are sharply defined, drawing the gaze to his loincloth, which barely covers his groin. Beneath it, his penis swells into an erection, lifting the folds of the fabric. Christ might be dead, but his penis promises his restoration to life (Plate 8). It is an intense image of a powerfully sexualized masculine virility, similarly conveyed in contemporaneous portrayals of the Man of Sorrows &ndash; the name given to a common devotional image focusing on the bloodied physicality of Christ&rsquo;s suffering, torture and death. One of the most astonishing is a Ludwig Krug engraving (c. 1510&ndash;32), in which Christ sits between his mother and the disciple John, looking straight at the viewer. On his head is a thick crown of thorns; the spear slash in his side is clearly visible. He shows the viewer the nail wounds in his hands, which are bound together with rope. A wide loincloth is wrapped around his waist, but it rises up from his groin to wind tightly around Christ&rsquo;s extraordinarily large, thick erection. In this engraving, the physical realities of Christ&rsquo;s death are vividly countered by his active, living corpse: he sits up and raises his hands; his open eyes reveal an all-seeing gaze; and his penis is powerfully erected into life. It is a profoundly theological image (Plate 9). Single and celibate. Asexual and childfree. In the text-centric modern West, we have become so accustomed to the neutered Christ of the New Testament that it is difficult to comprehend or even perceive the veneration of the sexualized virility of this divine man within those societies preceding our own. But across the visual cultures of late antique, medieval and Renaissance Europe, close attention to Christ&rsquo;s genitals in legends, relics, icons and artwork served not only to highlight his maleness and his humanity, but his death-defying divine virility. Whether newly circumcised, prepubescent, or maturely erect, the divine penis of the post-biblical Christ inherited the sexualized, life-giving agency of the phallic body of the God of the Bible &ndash; with one important exception. In the religious imagination, Christ tended to remain tantalizingly chaste and sexually innocent. The God of the Bible did not</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.ttwep01uuryv"><span class="c4">Chapter 8</span></h1><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;DIVINE SEX </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In a modern, airy building in Jerusalem, there is an astonishing woman. She has long, thick hair, sweeping down over her shoulders to fall between her breasts. There, twin babies are carefully positioned, their tiny faces turned towards her nipples. She meets the eyes of anyone who looks at her, her face tenderly expressive, her eyebrows slightly raised. Her arms are long and slender, the colour of warm sand. She extends them down the length of her torso, her wrists dressed with bangles, her hands coming together to meet between her legs. Large, leafy tattoos cover her thighs, stencilling her skin with ibexes nibbling budding trees. She holds open her labia, revealing the dark, long opening of her vagina. Her gaze remains steady. She is the wife of God. This beautiful clay figurine was found in the excavated remains of a Late Bronze Age site in the Shephelah region of what is now modern Israel (Plate 10). Dated to the thirteenth century BCE, she is a manifestation of the high goddess venerated across the southern Levant, an image inexpensively crafted for her worshippers to use in their rituals at home. She was a divine revealer of the secrets of new life, whose open labia manifested a powerful liminality: the inside-and-outside, entrance-and-exit place at which sexual potency, fecundity and birth were located. But in Jerusalem&rsquo;s Israel Museum, her open labia signal that she is little more than a commodified sex object: &lsquo;This figurine may represent Asherah, the sacred prostitute&rsquo;, reads the notice positioned next to her in the display case. It is a shocking and misleading caricature, grounded in a centuries-old, biblically derived hostility towards the goddess once venerated as the traditional consort of Yahweh, the God of the Bible. This hostility seeps through the pages of the Hebrew Bible. In its story of the religious past, the worship of the goddess called Asherah is well known: her statues and symbols are frequently said to stand in temples and sanctuaries across the Iron Age kingdoms of Israel and Judah. But her cult is presented as an abhorrent manifestation of the &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; polytheism polluting the land given by Yahweh to Abraham and his descendants. It is a religious deviancy repeatedly likened to sexual malpractice, so that those &lsquo;idolatrous&rsquo; Israelites and Judahites who stray after other deities are accused of &lsquo;whoring&rsquo; after them, &lsquo;sprawling&rsquo; beneath them, &lsquo;getting hot&rsquo; and acting as an &lsquo;adulteress&rsquo; in betraying their exclusive commitment to God.1 Metaphorically but authoritatively coupled in the Bible with female prostitution and promiscuity, the veneration of Asherah was consequently imagined by older generations of scandalized historians to have been little more than a titillating sex-cult, in which the goddess functioned as a divine patron of open-air orgies and sacred prostitution &ndash; for which there is no compelling evidence.2 But the sexualized language of the biblical slur against Asherah was adopted unquestioningly as historical fact &ndash; giving rise to the distorted assumptions regurgitated alongside the goddess figurine in the Israel Museum today. More recently, however, Asherah has been rehabilitated, and scholars are now widely agreed that she functioned traditionally as Yahweh&rsquo;s consort. As a number of biblical writers inadvertently confess, his temple in Jerusalem housed Asherah&rsquo;s cult statue; her cult object &ndash; a stylized sacred tree &ndash; was planted or positioned next to his altars; and kings and queens of Israel and Judah sponsored her worship in their royal sanctuaries.3 These admissions on the part of the biblical writers are striking. They demonstrate that even their own account of the religious past &ndash; as distorted with bias as it is &ndash; could not completely ignore so important a goddess. Asherah&rsquo;s pre-biblical career is best known from Late Bronze Age Ugarit (1550&ndash;1200 BCE), where she was known as Athirat. Here, she was the powerful wife of El and the mother of a major group of deities known as the &lsquo;Seventy Sons&rsquo;, indicating that her partnership with El was extremely fecund. But her role was more than maternal. As El&rsquo;s partner, she was a powerful intercessor, mediating debates and disputes between the gods and petitioning her husband on their behalf. And yet she was more than the First Lady of domestic politics. She was also known as the &lsquo;Lady of the Sea&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Lady who tramples the Sea Serpent&rsquo; &ndash; titles suggesting she once played a role in the ordering of the cosmos by commanding or subduing the watery monster with whom so many other deities would later contend. Her influential role in the human politics of Ugarit was also celebrated in her function as a divine wet nurse to Ugarit&rsquo;s kings, who relied on her to nurture and endorse their dynasties. As an ancient goddess of the highest calibre, her presence in the mythological story worlds of her worshippers underscored the authoritative status of the male deity with whom she was partnered. As Athirat of Late Bronze Age Ugarit, this was El. And as Asherah in the Iron Age kingdoms of Israel and Judah, this was Yahweh. Fig. 19. The sacred tree was a common visual motif across the Levant, and closely associated with goddesses &ndash; including Asherah. Dated to the eighth century BCE, this example appears with other religious symbols and inscriptions inked onto large storage jars discovered at Kuntillet &lsquo;Ajrud in northern Sinai. Caprids flank the tree, nibbling at its lotus flowers. Fig. 20. An ivory relief of a high-status goddess, excavated from a thirteenth-century BCE grave in Minet el-Beida, the harbour serving the city of Ugarit. Although her identity is uncertain, she is usually assumed to be Athirat. Enthroned on a mountaintop, the goddess is flanked by caprids, who eat from the fronds in her hands. While Asherah&rsquo;s relationship with Yahweh is usually presented as an abomination in the Bible, a collection of ancient Hebrew inscriptions, sensationally unearthed in the 1960s and 1970s, confirms her role as his consort. Dated to the eighth century BCE, these inscriptions present Yahweh and Asherah as a divine power-couple petitioned for protective blessings by their worshippers. One inscription was found above the entrance to a highstatus, rock-cut tomb at Khirbet el-Qom in the West Bank. It confers a blessing from &lsquo;Yahweh and his Asherah&rsquo; upon the dead occupant of the tomb, a wealthy man named Uriyahu, who requires divine protection against those who might ransack his grave and disturb his peaceful existence in the underworld. At the same time, other Hebrew-speakers were scribbling appeals to Yahweh and Asherah on votive pottery at a desert waystation at Kuntillet &lsquo;Ajrud, a stopover site on a network of ancient trade routes crossing the Sinai. These inscriptions are among a number of petitions scrawled by travellers to secure the blessings of various regional deities for their family and friends at home. Their messages are addressed to gods residing in particular temple locations, including &lsquo;Yahweh of Samaria and his Asherah&rsquo; and &lsquo;Yahweh of Teman and his Asherah&rsquo;. These appeals to distinctive, localized manifestations of the divine couple indicate that the pairing of Yahweh and the goddess was common in sanctuaries across the area. Taken together with the Khirbet el-Qom tomb inscription, these appeals suggest that most Yahweh worshippers did not share the biblical writers&rsquo; derogatory view of Asherah. Rather, they considered her to be the traditional partner of their high god Yahweh, and they worshipped her as a protective, life-giving goddess, able to mediate divine blessings to Yahweh&rsquo;s people.4 But the protective force of Yahweh and Asherah was unable to withstand the onslaught of imperial invasions in their homelands. And it was Asherah who paid the price. Her state cults waned in the aftermath of the Assyrian assault on the kingdom of Israel&rsquo;s capital, Samaria, in 722 BCE, and the later Babylonian destruction of Judah&rsquo;s Jerusalem temple in 587 BCE. Although there is some evidence to suggest that Asherah worship continued in some forms at these and other sites, the imperial destruction of these tiny kingdoms, and the devastating desecration of their temples, irrevocably damaged traditional religion and the local networks &ndash; political, economic and social &ndash; on which it relied. Asherah would never recover her prestigious position as a state deity and the consort of God. In the late sixth or early fifth century BCE, when Persia was the dominant imperial force throughout the Levant, an elite group descended from Judah&rsquo;s exiles living in Mesopotamia was granted permission to return to Jerusalem and rebuild Yahweh&rsquo;s temple. But in remaking their temple, they also remade their religion. The traditional polytheism of the past was remodelled in the image of what is sometimes described as an &lsquo;emergent monotheism&rsquo;, but is more accurately understood as a radical form of pantheon reduction: Yahweh lost his wife, while other members of his divine council were downgraded from deities to minor divine beings, heavenly messengers, or cosmic abstractions. Cultural memories of the wife of God were twisted into the theological distortions now evident in the biblical texts in which she appears. Asherah was recast as a toxic idol and &ndash; alongside other members of the former pantheon &ndash; blamed for the disasters of earlier generations: she was held responsible for seducing Yahweh&rsquo;s followers away from him, prompting him to punish them with military destruction and territorial displacement. But a glimpse of the true nature of the divine couple&rsquo;s relationship can be found in an ancient poem in Genesis. It recycles an even older incantation into a ritual song conveying Yahweh&rsquo;s blessings upon the legendary ancestor Joseph. The incantation invokes a series of deities to bestow sexual masculinity and fruitfulness upon Joseph&rsquo;s penis, euphemistically described as his &lsquo;taut bow&rsquo; and &lsquo;strong hand&rsquo;. Included in the divine roll-call is a goddess bearing the title &lsquo;Breasts-and-Womb&rsquo; &ndash; a likely epithet of Asherah, given it is used of Athirat, her older incarnation at Ugarit. She is paired in the poem with a deity called &lsquo;Father&rsquo; and &lsquo;Most High&rsquo; &ndash; ritual titles of the God of the Bible, inherited from Athirat&rsquo;s husband, El: From the God of your ancestor, who supports you, from Shadday who blesses you: the blessings of Heaven above, the blessings of Deep crouching below; the blessings of Breasts-and-Womb, the blessings of your Father, warrior Most High; the blessings of the Everlasting Mountains, [the blessings] of the outlying Eternal Hills.5 The coupling of &lsquo;Father, warrior Most High&rsquo; and &lsquo;Breasts-and-Womb&rsquo; points to the sexualized collaboration of these deities, paralleling the pairing of &lsquo;Heaven&rsquo; and &lsquo;Deep&rsquo; &ndash; the divinized, primeval parts of the universe, whose union birthed and built the very cosmos.6 The poem hints at an ancient pantheon, in which the coupling of the high god and high goddess is set within the frame of an ordered, fertile creation. Crucially, the sexualized structuring of the cosmos was as social as it was architectural. In the religious worldviews of ancient south-west Asian cultures, sex was not only procreative and pleasurable, but socially civilizing, binding both the universe and its inhabitants &ndash; whether divine or human &ndash; into the intense relationships by which life flourished. While a handful of these relationships in the divine realm were celibate or virginal, most were cast as the sexualized pairing of a husband and wife, father and mother, or brother and sister. Sometimes, however, a deity might take a human as a sexual partner. The God of the Bible was well acquainted with divine&ndash;human sex &ndash; but at first blush, it appears to be an activity of which he firmly disapproves, as a fleeting myth in Genesis suggests. In this book&rsquo;s story of beginnings, the creation of humanity is swiftly followed by a series of human transgressions: eating banned fruit; the first murder; and then &ndash; worst of all &ndash; sex with gods. As humans obediently begin to fill the earth with their offspring, a group of junior deities known as the Sons of God (the members of Yahweh&rsquo;s divine council) find the daughters of mortal men so alluring that they &lsquo;take&rsquo; these girls for themselves and have sex with them. The girls give birth to the Nephilim &ndash; a mythical warrior race of divine&ndash;human hybrids, cast elsewhere in the Bible as fearsome giants.7 In this fifthcentury BCE text, the fault appears to lie not only with the predatory Sons of God, but with mortal men&rsquo;s daughters, too, whose sexual appeal is demonstrably dangerous. God is so appalled at what he describes as human &lsquo;wickedness&rsquo; that he regrets having created a now dangerously warped humanity. He decides to punish them by curbing mortal lifespans to a mere 120 years, but then quickly intensifies the penalty by resolving to kill off humans altogether. He sends the Flood. This is likely a stripped-back version of a much fuller myth describing the corruption of the earliest humans. It is found in its longer form in a composition called the Book of Watchers, an early version of which is included in a text known as 1 Enoch (c. fourth century BCE). Here, the Sons of God are the Watchers &ndash; a group of 200 divine beings who function as God&rsquo;s emissaries (or &lsquo;angels&rsquo;). Unable to resist the charms of mortal women, the Watchers descend from the heavens to have sex with them, but defile their holiness in the process by engaging in what is essentially depicted as cross-species sex. For the women, however, sex with these divine beings is not defiling, but enlightening: the Watchers teach them the divine secrets of magic, medicine and metallurgy, so that they can not only better harness the powers of the cosmos, but render themselves even more beautiful by making and wearing magical jewellery. Meanwhile, the giant Nephilim born to the women go on the rampage; having gobbled up the earth&rsquo;s supply of food, they begin to devour humans. It is only when God&rsquo;s senior emissaries (the archangels Michael, Sariel, Raphael and Gabriel) hear the cries of despair from mortal men that they ask God to intervene and rid the world of all its dangerously corrupted life forms &ndash; hence the Flood. It is a story that would remain popular &ndash; and alarming &ndash; within ancient Jewish and early Christian circles. Indeed, by the middle of the first century CE, Paul was alluding to it when he insisted that women should keep their heads veiled or covered during prayer and prophecy &lsquo;on account of the angels&rsquo;, to prevent them from attracting the attention of the divine beings watching over worship.8 And by the beginning of the second century, the story had become a repeated motif in Christian teaching, warning human sinners of God&rsquo;s punishing ways, much as the New Testament letters of 2 Peter and Jude suggest.9 But God&rsquo;s destructive response to sex between deities and humans in Genesis and 1 Enoch is striking in view of other tales in which he engages in sex with human or human-like women himself. Clearly, the primary concern for the God of the Bible is not so much an anxiety about divine sex, nor the sexual transgression of the boundary between the human and divine worlds, but the defence of God&rsquo;s own and exclusive prerogative to have sex. God&rsquo;s first sexual encounter occurs long before the birth of the Nephilim. In the Garden of Eden, food from the sacred tree might have been off the menu, but sating sexual appetites was divinely ordained. God&rsquo;s pairing of Adam and Eve seemingly comes to fruition when Eve bears Cain &ndash; the first human child. But her emphatic declaration at the birth of her son credits God, not Adam, with paternity: &lsquo;I have procreated a man with Yahweh!&rsquo;10 This more literal translation of the Hebrew is rarely seen. Most renderings of this verse default to a theologically fudged interpretation, so that Eve is merely presented as claiming that Yahweh has &lsquo;helped&rsquo; her to &lsquo;acquire a man&rsquo;, as any good fertility god might. But the very language of this Hebrew text signals a bodily dynamic well beyond this, for the woman&rsquo;s words are pointedly precise: she is claiming that Yahweh has fathered her first child. There is nothing virginal about this birth. Eve&rsquo;s boast is indicative of a female sexual agency wholly unlike the sanitized passivity of her later biblical antitype, the &lsquo;Virgin&rsquo; Mary. Her words reveal she is God&rsquo;s collaborative partner in the creation of new human life. But this proactive role also points to a long-lost mythic backstory to Eve&rsquo;s character. Although in her biblical form she is a human woman, her choice of vocabulary is the language of goddesses: in asserting that she has &lsquo;procreated&rsquo; a man, she uses a specialized, technical term for divine reproduction also used of goddesses in the myths from Ugarit.11 Indeed, like the Ugaritic goddess Athirat, Eve is called &lsquo;Mother of all Living&rsquo;, and even her name (hawwah in Hebrew) likely means &lsquo;life giver&rsquo; or &lsquo;living one&rsquo;, evoking an epithet of Athirat in her glorious title &lsquo;the Lady, the Living One, the Goddess&rsquo;.12 These features of Eve&rsquo;s characterization in Genesis suggest that, before her biblical career, she was more akin to a life-bearing goddess appropriately located in the heavenly Garden of Eden &ndash; and hence a most suitable sexual partner for a male deity. In the Bible, however, God&rsquo;s most significant and sexualized relationship is not with a goddess or a goddess-like figure, but with his other wife, Israel. The personification of a city, territory, nation or social group as a woman is well attested in (often masculinist, patriarchal) cultures across the globe, but in the biblical texts, the female personification of Israel plays a sustained and crucial role in articulating the intense and exclusive relationship between God and his worshippers. It is a relationship so intimate that his love for them is frequently expressed in the language of sexual desire. And yet, in some books of the Hebrew Bible, the erotic tone of this imagery not only moves from the emotional to the physical, but takes on a much darker hue, casting God as a powerful sexual predator, and Israel as a coquettish young girl. The book of Hosea offers a vivid example. Here, Israel is a capricious teenager whose sexual allure so intoxicates God, he falls to scheming obsessively and possessively to make her his wife. &lsquo;I will now seduce her&rsquo;, he says of Israel; &lsquo;I will take her walking into the wilderness and speak to her heart . . . and there she will cry out&rsquo;.13 These words betray more than the romantic fantasy of a love-struck deity. God&rsquo;s language here marks a shift from passion to threat: in claiming he will &lsquo;seduce&rsquo; her, he uses a Hebrew expression more usually employed in the Bible to describe the rape of captive women. And in describing Israel&rsquo;s vocal response, he uses a term that can convey both the noise of sexual gratification and religious joy. God&rsquo;s dangerous sense of sexual entitlement skews his planned attack on the girl into the distorted conviction that she will enjoy her rape &ndash; and scream in orgasmic ecstasy.14 This image of sexual violation is unsettling enough. But nowhere in the Bible is the portrayal of God&rsquo;s sex life more disturbing than in two stories in the book of Ezekiel. Like other biblical narrators, Ezekiel reasons that the military defeat and imperial subjugation that befell Yahweh&rsquo;s people in the sixth century BCE was a divine punishment for worshipping other gods. Here, too, Israel is cast as God&rsquo;s wife, but her whoring after foreign deities provokes her husband&rsquo;s fury and punishment. According to Ezekiel, her wanton behaviour in marriage is the culmination of a long history of social and sexual deviancy. Their relationship begins in the wilderness, where God finds an abandoned baby girl, her umbilical cord still attached, deliberately cast away from the rest of humanity: &lsquo;You were abhorred on the day of your birth&rsquo;, scorns God, as he reminds her that she had been neither washed of birth blood, nor rubbed with a protective salt scrub and swaddled.15 And yet God acknowledges her, commanding her to live and grow. Only when she has obediently matured to puberty does he notice her again. Reminiscing lasciviously about this subsequent encounter, God comments: &lsquo;. . . your breasts were formed, your [pubic] hair had grown; you were naked and bare! I passed by you and looked at you: you were at the age for lovemaking. I spread the corner of my cloak over you, and covered your nakedness; I pledged myself to you and entered into a covenant with you . . . You became mine.&rsquo;16 The voyeuristic tone to his words is not lost in this English translation, which barely manages to soften the graphic sexual nature of his actions: God&rsquo;s gaze is upon the girl&rsquo;s exposed sexual organs, moving him to cover her genitals (&lsquo;nakedness&rsquo;) with his own &ndash; his spreading cloak politely functioning here as an image of his mounting her, much as in the book of Ruth, in which the eponymous heroine urges a sleepy Boaz to have sex with her by spreading the corner of his cloak over her.17 The sexual euphemisms continue, for it is by penetrating the girl&rsquo;s body that God &lsquo;enters into&rsquo; a binding covenant with her &ndash; an unequal power relationship in which the forging of the deity&rsquo;s exclusive and proprietary claim to Israel is presented as the sexual consummation of a man&rsquo;s possession of a bride: &lsquo;you became mine&rsquo;.18 Jewish and Christian interpreters have tended to soften and sanitize this encounter &ndash; either by reductive means, so that the episode is &lsquo;merely&rsquo; a metaphor or allegory depicting intense religious intimacy, or by fantasizing that romantic notions of a committed, heteronormative love find their archetype in God, so that he is the paradigmatic devoted husband. But this is wishful thinking &ndash; and it will not do. Ezekiel&rsquo;s story is reflective of a patriarchal, masculinist culture, in which girls and women tended to be valued and defined in terms of their bodily configurations with men: as daughters, sisters, wives, mothers, or sex-workers. The biblical God cannot and should not be let off the hook. Here, he is a predatory alpha male, whose sexual entitlement entirely shapes the identity and fate of this displaced and vulnerable young girl. Indeed, it is only after sex that God formally rehabilitates his young bride by means of actions reminiscent of the rituals denied her at birth: he bathes her, washing away the dried blood of birth and the wet blood of puberty, and then rubs her not with salt, but with sacred oil. Her objectification continues as he dresses her in rich fabrics and puts soft leather sandals on her feet; he decorates her with earrings, a nose ring, bangles, a necklace and crown, so that she looks like a statue of a goddess in a temple. He gives her the ritual foods commonly offered to deities &ndash; choice flour, honey and fragrant oil &ndash; and transfers her from the wilderness to civilization, where she is rapturously celebrated for the beauty God has bestowed upon her. And here she is fixed: an unspeaking, passive ornament of her husband&rsquo;s hegemonic, sexualized masculinity. For God, this is a fruitful relationship: the girl gives birth to his sons and daughters &ndash; God&rsquo;s own worshippers.19 But it also results in extreme sexual violence. In a battery of fierce denunciations, the deity accuses his wife of adultery and prostitution with his rivals, the gods and kings of other nations: &lsquo;Adulterous wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband!&rsquo; he spits. According to God, her sexual deviancy is so depraved that she pays her lovers for sex with the treasures received from her husband: &lsquo;Gifts are given to all whores, but you gave your gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from all around for your whorings!&rsquo; He shames her further, accusing her of being in such a permanent state of impure arousal that her vagina constantly drips with wetness.20 Her punishment is brutal: God gathers her lovers and strips her naked in front of them; her legs are wrenched apart, her genitalia exposed. It is an invitation to gang-rape her. A mob is summoned &ndash; to stone her, cut her, stab her and set her home alight. This scene of graphic, frenzied sexual violence is the theological moneyshot, for the brutality wrought against his wife triggers in God a climactic gratification, by which his psychosexual anger suddenly appears spent: &lsquo;Thus I will satisfy my fury on you, and my jealousy shall turn away from you; I will be calm, and will be angry no longer&rsquo;.21 Once she has learned her lesson, he will take her back. In a parallel narrative, a few chapters later, God again looks back on his alleged cuckolding with venomous fury. This time, Israel is personified as two sisters, Oholah and Oholibah, who represent the cities Samaria and Jerusalem. Their sexual crimes, God claims, begin even before he makes them his brides: in their youth, they seek out the Egyptians, cast as animalized foreigners with penises &lsquo;like those of donkeys&rsquo; and gushing semen &lsquo;like that of stallions&rsquo;, who squeeze and fondle the young girls&rsquo; breasts and ejaculate over them.22 Even so, God marries them. But the sisters&rsquo; sexual depravity only worsens &ndash; so much so, they seek out lovers who disgust them, and even sacrifice to those lovers the children they have borne their divine husband.23 God&rsquo;s violent response is again profoundly disturbing: he gathers his wives&rsquo; lovers, who strip the sisters naked and abuse them. Oholah&rsquo;s children are seized, and she is put to death by the sword.24 Her younger sister, Oholibah, endures a more prolonged suffering. God again summons her lovers, instructing them to disfigure his unfaithful wife by cutting off her nose and ears, to expose her genitalia and to burn her children.25 God then gives his wife her dead sister&rsquo;s cup of &lsquo;desolation and horror&rsquo;, commanding her to drink until she is intoxicated with such sorrowful shame that the cup will shatter in her hands. In a startling image of self-harm wrought by abuse, God decrees she will use its jagged pieces to mutilate herself, gnawing on its sherds and hacking off her breasts.26 Most damaging of all, perhaps, is the moral of the tale: the fate of God&rsquo;s wife is explicitly exhibited in this narrative as a warning to all women, lest they too dishonour their husbands. These horrifying tales in the book of Ezekiel have proved deeply troubling for many readers &ndash; past and present, secular and religious. As endorsements, albeit ancient ones, of male sexual predation, exploitation and misogynistic violence, the value systems evoked in these narratives ostensibly conflict sharply with those of the modern West. They not only degrade and vilify female sexuality, but enshrine the sexual and domestic abuse of girls and women with ongoing biblical authority. Theologically, the sexual grooming and graphic violence God inflicts on his young wife is immensely difficult for some modern-day believers to reconcile with their idealized constructs of God. But for many Jewish and Christian readers, it is more specifically the graphic portrayal of a sexually active deity that has proved unbearable: it has been mistranslated, dismissed as &lsquo;mere&rsquo; allegory, or simply ignored. Indeed, by the second century CE, the story of God having sex with his pubescent bride in Ezekiel was banned by the rabbis from public reading in the synagogue &ndash; a ruling attributed to Rabbi Eliezer (c. 100 CE), who was said to have interrupted a man reading aloud the opening words of the story (&lsquo;Mortal, proclaim to Jerusalem her abominations&rsquo;) with the sarcastic rebuke, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go out and proclaim the abominations of your mother? &rsquo;27 For the ancient rabbis, there was no pretence that the lurid, explicit portrayal of divine&ndash;human sex was &lsquo;simply&rsquo; symbolic. Ezekiel&rsquo;s story was simultaneously a metaphor and a mythological truth, revealing the torrid nature of the physical relationship between the mother of the people and their God. Better to censor it entirely than to repeat aloud its shocking truths. By contrast, almost all the early Church Fathers refused to recognize the sexualized, gendered bodies of God and Israel in these biblical narratives &ndash; even while relying on their corporeal imagery to teach Christians about the concrete, bodily realities of sin and salvation. Origen was staggered by the implication that Ezekiel presents a vision of the corporeality of God and his wife. &lsquo;It is said to me: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t allegorize, don&rsquo;t explain figuratively!&rdquo; &rsquo; he complained. &lsquo;Let them give an opinion on this, I ask: Jerusalem has breasts, and at one time they are not bound, and at another they are made firm, and she has an umbilical cord and is reproached because &ldquo;it was not cut&rdquo;. How is it possible to understand these things without allegorical interpretation?&rsquo;28 Origen&rsquo;s approach to these difficult texts would dominate subsequent Christian readings for centuries. In spite of a confessional commitment to the incarnate reality of the divine body of Christ, Church theologians remained incredulous that God&rsquo;s body was ever in full sexualized view in the book of Ezekiel. These older forms of resistance reading in Jewish and Christian circles continue today. In standard modern translations of the Tanakh and the Christian Bible, the graphic sexual imagery of these troubling texts is softened or obscured with sanitized vocabulary and clunky euphemisms, theologically veiling their portrayal of a sexually active God.29 But for the ancient writers of biblical books, God was so familiarly corporeal, masculine and sexual, that these characteristics were easily harnessed to tell the story of his intense and turbulent relationship with his people, Israel &ndash; a people he expected to desire, love and obey him as a good wife should. In the eyes of the biblical writers, God&rsquo;s traditional wife, Asherah, might have been cast aside, but he himself retained his position as a divine husband, and wedded himself instead to his worshippers. This is why early Christians could so easily conjure the image of Christ as their Heavenly Bridegroom. It was deeply embedded in their religious DNA. As early as the mid first century CE, Paul was telling Christians in Corinth that they were &lsquo;promised in marriage to one husband . . . as a chaste virgin to Christ&rsquo;.30 Similarly, in his letter to the Christian community in Rome, Paul cast the intimate relationship between Christ and his Church as the fertile, bodily union of a husband and wife, an image later extended in the book of Revelation and the epistle to the Ephesians to describe the Church as Christ&rsquo;s bride.31 Both these texts draw on Ezekiel&rsquo;s portrayal of God dressing up his young wife like a goddess statue to describe the sexual allure of Christ&rsquo;s bride, but in Ephesians, the parallels are disturbingly pronounced. Here, Christ not only cleanses and beautifies his bride to render her more desirable and &lsquo;holy&rsquo;, but the stark power imbalance of divine&ndash;human marriage is used as a paradigm for mortal marriages: &lsquo;For the husband is the head of the wife just as Christ is the head of the Church . . . Just as the Church is submissive to Christ, so also wives are to be, in everything, to their husbands&rsquo;.32 These and other early Christian texts would authoritatively endorse the self-portrayal of the Church as the bride of Christ for at least the next thousand years. This was a marriage supposedly ordained by Jesus himself, who in the New Testament Gospels refers to himself as the &lsquo;bridegroom&rsquo; of his followers.33 But in other ancient Christian texts, Mary Magdalene appears to play the bridal role of the Church itself. In both the Gospel of Mary (second century CE) and the Gospel of Philip (early third century CE), she is cast as the disciple Jesus loves the most; she is his &lsquo;beloved&rsquo; and his &lsquo;consort&rsquo;, with whom he not only shares his most authoritative, esoteric teachings, but his physical affection in the form of kisses &ndash; much to the irritation of the other disciples.34 While attempts to argue that Mary Magdalene was originally the wife of Jesus have repeatedly proved unpersuasive, scholars are broadly agreed that she was celebrated in nascent Christianity as a crucial player in the early Jesus movement. Not only was she perceived to have been a prominent member of Jesus&rsquo; inner circle, but she was held by some to have been commissioned by the newly risen Christ to teach the other disciples about his divinity and his heavenly kingdom. Her elevated status in the Gospels of Mary and Philip reflects the continued potency of these early traditions in some eastern-empire communities, in which she was revered as a great leader of the Church.35 But as the scholar April DeConick shows, growing anxieties about the religious authority of women, coupled with increasing conflicts between churches in the Roman East and West, led to her marginalization.36 Eventually, in what would come to be more prominent theological traditions, she would be cast as a prostitute. Like Asherah and Eve before her, Mary Magdalene was overwhelmingly disempowered by her deliberate denigration as the embodiment of sexual deviancy. The life-giving virility of Christ and his bodily commitment to his Church was vividly drawn on much older biblical models of divine marriage and the masculinized, corporeal sexuality of God. Throughout the Bible, God engages in sexualized or eroticized relationships with a variety of female or feminized consorts. Some are deliberately marginalized and vilified; others are cast in the subordinate role of unruly or obedient bride. All were subjected to a series of theological distortions later wrought by a misogynistic monotheism, making space for the continued degrading of the sexualized female body (whether human or divine) in the religious systems the Bible would come to shape. But at the heart of God&rsquo;s relationships with these consorts &ndash; even if at times deeply suppressed &ndash; was a complex of ancient ideas in which cosmic creation mapped onto genital generation, divine corporeality mapped onto human physicality, religious awe mapped onto erotic allure, and spiritual intensity mapped onto sexual intimacy. On the body of the biblical God, the divine penis was more than an accessory of patriarchal masculinity. It was the corporeal manifestation of the divine thrust of all life &ndash; heavenly and earthly, cultural and social &ndash; in the cosmos.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.wcc21d7dgsgt"><span class="c4">Chapter 9</span></h1><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.i0u2yk6rgl4n"><span class="c6">PART 3 TORSO</span></h2><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The climb from St Catherine&rsquo;s Monastery to the summit of Jebel Musa, the most sacred mountain in southern Sinai, takes about two and a half hours. At least, it does for those sensible enough to take the winding Camel Path to the top, rather than all 3,750 steps of the painfully steep, boulder-block stairway. Along the way, the tributes and trash of sacred tourism are a constant reminder that this is an ancient pilgrimage trail: ramshackle shrines; rocks daubed with Christian crosses, Arabic blessings and people&rsquo;s names; empty Coke cans and sweet wrappers. When the path joins the narrow stony stairway for the final sharp ascent, the chatter of pilgrims and tourists gives way to a quieter, if breathless, contemplation and a sense of awe that has rendered Jebel Musa a holy place. Known in Judaism and Christianity as Mount Sinai, it is here that Moses is said to have seen God&rsquo;s feet resting on his sky pavement. These are the rocks, tradition has it, from which were hewn the tablets of the Ten Commandments. Here is the very spot where Moses asked to see God&rsquo;s body in its most fulsome glory. There is no sign of a divine body today. Instead, there are Bedouins of the local Jebeliya tribe, offering blankets to pilgrims and escorting them down to the wooden tea huts just below the summit. There is also a tiny mosque and a little chapel, each constructed of large red blocks of mountain rock. The mosque has stood since the twelfth century CE, but the chapel is surprisingly new. It was built in 1934, following the collapse of its sixteenth-century predecessor &ndash; a collapse allegedly caused by local treasure hunters digging for Moses&rsquo; lost tablets of stone. But the walls of both the mosque and the chapel contain the recycled remnants of a much older building. There was already a bigger church here on the summit in the fourth century CE. And it is thanks to an extraordinary woman named Egeria that we know of its existence. In 381 CE, she left her home in north-west Iberia for a three-year pilgrimage around the holy sites of Egypt and the Levant. While she was away, she wrote regularly to her friends, detailing the places and people she had encountered. In doing so, Egeria created one of the earliest surviving Christian travelogues &ndash; a compilation which would be used by later generations of pious men to compile their own guidebooks to God. By December 383 CE, Egeria had begun a month-long expedition around the countless monasteries and churches that once peppered Sinai. Having lodged with one of the small monastic communities living in the southern mountain range, she made the journey up &lsquo;Sina&rsquo; &ndash; the Holy Mountain of God. Her account of the experience feels as fresh as the day it was written: . . . the toil was great, for I had to go up on foot, the ascent being impossible in the saddle, and yet I did not feel the toil, on the side of the ascent, I say, the toil, because I realised that the desire which I had was being fulfilled at God&rsquo;s bidding. In that place there is now a church, not great in size, for the place itself, that is the summit of the mountain, is not very great; nevertheless, the church itself is great in grace . . . No one, however, dwells on the very summit of the central mountain; there is nothing there excepting only the church and the cave where holy Moses was.1 Today, the little red chapel atop Jebel Musa likely stands on the same spot as the church Egeria saw. But it is the cave &lsquo;where holy Moses was&rsquo; that is the most ancient religious feature of the mountain peak: jutting up against the western wall of the chapel is an enormous boulder, split open by a long, low cleft, just big enough to crouch inside.2 According to ancient tradition, this is the very place in which Moses waited to see God&rsquo;s body. But he didn&rsquo;t quite get what he bargained for. The oldest version of the story is found in Exodus. It is a book combining ancient myths, old poems, later theologies and several literary sources &ndash; some perhaps as early as the eighth century BCE, others as late as the third century BCE. But its basic features have stabilized into an intimate, intense tale of a remarkable series of encounters with God. Having ascended Mount Sinai for one of his regular meetings with the deity, Moses attempts to negotiate an agreement with his god before continuing the arduous journey with the Israelites from Egypt to the Promised Land: &lsquo;How shall it be known that I have found favour in your sight, I and your people?&rsquo; he asks. &lsquo;Please, show me your Glory.&rsquo; It is a bold request to see the divine body that has been hidden by thick clouds during the Israelites&rsquo; trek through the wilderness. Yahweh agrees &ndash; on condition that he will not reveal everything. &lsquo;I shall make all my splendour pass before your face . . . but you may not see my face, for no mortal may see me and live&rsquo;. In its narrative context, it is a capricious assertion, for Yahweh and Moses have already enjoyed a number of conversations &lsquo;face to face&rsquo; &ndash; and Moses has survived. But the deity is insistent and directs Moses towards a rock &ndash; long since identified as the giant cracked boulder atop Jebel Musa &ndash; from where he can view God&rsquo;s teasing appearance. &lsquo;While my Glory passes by&rsquo;, Yahweh explains, &lsquo;I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand as I pass by; then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back. But my face shall not be seen.&rsquo;3 It is one of the more carefully choreographed exhibitions of God&rsquo;s anatomy in the Bible. Like a celebrity stretching out a hand to block the paparazzi, God only permits Moses to see him from behind as he moves away. In the story, this is supposed to be a sign of divine favour. And yet, culturally, the back of a god was more usually a devastating sight: it not only signalled divine displeasure, but also presaged definitive disaster in one swift, ritual gesture of power. &lsquo;I will show them my back, not my face, in the day of their calamity,&rsquo; the biblical God frequently threatens &ndash; usually in response to his worshippers turning their own backs on him. &lsquo;They have turned their backs to me, and not their faces&rsquo;, he despairs, as he rails against his &lsquo;stiff-necked&rsquo; and &lsquo;stiff-backed&rsquo; people.4 It is a body language common to many societies &ndash; including those of the modern West, in which a turn of the back can speak volumes. With our backs turned, we might render ourselves potentially vulnerable to the unseen and unknown, or forcefully dominant in the face of those at whom we choose not to look. The cultural freight carried by the body language of the back was carefully managed in the religious traditions of ancient south-west Asia and Egypt. The gods were almost always portrayed as straight-backed and solidly upright, whether seated in splendour or standing in authority. Even the Egyptian sky goddess Nut, who bends her long, slender body on all fours over the earth, maintains an impressively straight back in ancient iconography. The solid back of a deity was not only a posture of steadfast and immovable power, but a manifestation of the bony sturdiness at the very core of the god, for running through the divine body was a backbone. Like a mortal body, the uprightness of the divine body was innately structured and maintained by its spine. But this rendered a god&rsquo;s back a crucial &ndash; if challenging &ndash; target in times of divine conflict or cosmic disaster. Ugarit&rsquo;s myths offer some vivid anatomical images: Baal&rsquo;s eventual triumph over the sea-god Yam is marked by the softening of Yam&rsquo;s skeleton and his collapse upon the ground: &lsquo;Yam goes groggy, falls to the ground; his joints go slack, his body slumps&rsquo;.5 And the goddesses Athirat and Anat each experience a bone-shaking transformation when faced with dangerous visitors or devastating news: &lsquo;her back muscles snap . . . her vertebrae rattle, her spine goes weak&rsquo;.6 The body language of the back shaped worshippers&rsquo; visual interactions with their deities in temples and other cult places. The gods were rarely &ndash; if ever &ndash; depicted in two-dimensional religious art with their backs turned towards the viewer. In a world in which sacred images were not simply symbolic representations but magical manifestations, the fixed image of a god&rsquo;s back was a dangerous curse no temple artisan or patron would dare execute, for fear of conjuring divine rejection or (perhaps worse) rendering the deity problematically unseeing. Even three-dimensional portrayals of the gods guarded against the cultural anxieties provoked by the potential sight of a deity&rsquo;s back: ceremonies manoeuvred the statue in ways made safe by the rituals of the priests, while the statues themselves were either clothed in ritually woven &lsquo;heavenly&rsquo; textiles to buffer mortals from the divine back, or inscribed with ritual declarations to magically counter any sense of passive vulnerability on the part of both the worshipper and the deity. But on the summit of the Holy Mountain, the threat to Moses is contained by careful stage management: strictly speaking, God promises that Moses will see his &lsquo;backparts&rsquo; or &lsquo;hindquarters&rsquo; &ndash; the same term used in the Hebrew Bible to describe the buttocks of an animal that are to be cleaned of dung before its sacrifice. The story evokes an image of a divine colossus striding past a diminutive Moses, swinging his giant hand to cover the rocky fissure in which Moses shelters as God passes by. Peering out from his small place of safety, like a child peeping through a crack in a door, Moses can only see Yahweh&rsquo;s &lsquo;hindquarters&rsquo; once the towering deity removes his hand from the rock as he walks away. He sees not the deadly back of God thrust menacingly into the face of an enemy, but the disappearing backside of a celestial celebrity. The precautions taken by God to protect Moses in this scene are a direct response to Moses&rsquo; request to behold the divine kabod (&lsquo;glory&rsquo;). This is not the language of grandiose transcendence or sycophantic flattery. It is an explicit request to encounter the very essence of divine corporeality: Moses wants to see God&rsquo;s luminescent, dazzling body.* The kabod of God is the same glowing, fiery emanation the prophet Ezekiel sees surrounding Yahweh&rsquo;s body when he glimpses the divine genitals; the same white-hot, radiant body that (almost four hundred years later) the eponymous hero of the book of Daniel is said to have seen enthroned: it is a white-clad body from which &lsquo;a stream of fire issues and flows out&rsquo;.7 This is the same blinding brilliance that settles on the top of the Holy Mountain in Sinai &lsquo;like a devouring fire&rsquo;, enveloped by thick clouds to protect mortals from its dangerous glare.8 And it is the same visible, blazing brightness that worshippers across ancient south-west Asia understood their gods to possess. A Sign of the Divine Wandering around a museum or the ruins of an ancient city, it is easy to forget that the religious past was a place of vivid colour. Worn and weathered images of ancient gods are the muted browns and greys of clay and stone, or the drab, mottled tones of tarnished silver and dulled bronze. The shiny metals, precious stones, vivid paints and deep dyes colouring images of ancient south-west Asian gods may have faded or gone, but enough traces remain, and stories survive, to suggest that the gods were spectacularly colourful. Their skin might be the blood-red of warriors, the hot gold of the sun, the orange of bright amber, the warm black of dark olives, the rich brown of cedars, the translucent white of alabaster, or the sharp silver of the moon. Their very divinity mapped them onto the coloured contours of the cosmos in myriad hues. And emanating from their bodies, shining out from their skin, was the dazzling radiance of a heavenly aura. One of the clearest iconographic portrayals of this divine radiance is found on a glazed brick used in a decorative frieze in a royal palace at Ashur &ndash; the ancient capital of the Assyrian kingdom, located on the Tigris River in what today is Iraq. Now in the British Museum, the painted brick is dated to the brief reign of Tukulti-Ninurta II (c. 890&ndash;884 BCE), and depicts the high god Ashur as a winged deity, stretching back his war bow as he moves through the skies, smartly dressed in a skirt pleated with fire and a conical helmet. Radiating from his body are thick wavy lines, bounded towards their outer edges by concentric circles that wrap themselves into the peak of his helmet, the tips of his bow and the hem of his skirt. Protruding from these circles are blazing tongues of fire (fig. 21). This is Ashur&rsquo;s melammu &ndash; a term used by the Assyrians and their neighbours to refer to the luminous, fiery radiance of divinity. Its range of uses suggests the divine radiance of Assyria&rsquo;s gods was very much like the kabod of the God of the Bible. The visual portrayal of the brilliant nimbus surrounding the bodies of the gods often combined two elements of religious iconography crucial to communicating divine power. One was the twin quiver of arrows worn on the backs of warring deities. A lovely example is now held in Yale University&rsquo;s Babylonian Collection. Dated to about 1800 BCE, the moulded clay plaque shows the goddess Ishtar standing triumphantly on two roaring, recumbent lions, her left leg extended in victory from the long folds of her skirt as she presses her foot down on a thickly maned neck. She holds a lowered scimitar in her right hand, and lifts a bow in her left. On her head is a crown of divinity, and bound around her chest are the tight straps of her arrow quivers, criss-crossed on her back. But the warrior and her weaponry appear almost as one: the tops of the quivers stand tall behind her shoulders, while their bases shoot out from behind her waist, so that her military might springs out of her body, just like the fearsome aura ancient south-west Asian gods came to acquire (fig. 22). Fig. 21. The Assyrian high god Ashur, drawing back his war bow in the heavens. The deity&rsquo;s blazing radiance emanates from his body. Once brightly coloured, the original image appears on an enamelled brick from a temple in the city of Ashur and is dated to the reign of King Tukulti-Ninurta II (c. 890&ndash;884 BCE). The other motif of divine power often incorporated into the iconography of divine radiance was the bright light emanating from the torsos of deities associated with the sun, moon and stars. Although this feature of divine power was often schematized in emblematic form as a fiery winged sun disc &ndash; a symbol common to ancient south-west Asian high gods &ndash; it was also seen on the gods in their human-like forms. The famous Hammurabi Stela, now in the Louvre, is better known for its cuneiform law code drawn up by King Hammurabi of Babylon (c. 1792&ndash;1750 BCE). But it also offers a striking illustration of divine radiance. In an image carved in relief at the top of the stela, Hammurabi enshrines his self-proclaimed role as the &lsquo;king of justice&rsquo; in a scene depicting his meeting with Shamash, the Babylonian sun-god and divine dispenser of justice. The king stands before the deity, who is seated in splendour on his imposing throne, his feet resting on a footstool of mountains. From Shamash&rsquo;s broad shoulders rise his signature motif of illuminating radiance &ndash; thick rays of light, akin to those that would encircle the Assyrian god Ashur&rsquo;s body almost a millennium later. The polished stone of the stela may be cool, black basalt, but the shimmering heat of Shamash&rsquo;s powerful body is almost palpable (fig. 23). Fig. 22. The goddess Ishtar (Inanna), armed with her bow, arrows and a scimitar, standing in triumph on the backs of roaring lions. The quivers on her back not only serve as the equipment of warfare, but manifest the military might springing from her body. This Mesopotamian clay plaque is dated to about 1800 BCE. Fig. 23. King Hammurabi of Babylon standing before Shamash, the solar god of justice, on the stela monumentalizing the king&rsquo;s laws. Shamash&rsquo;s radiance emanates from his shoulders. Dated to about 1760 BCE, the stela was looted from its Babylonian home and transported to Susa in 1158 BCE. From the third millennium BCE and well into the second, the luminescent radiance of the gods tended to be understood as a material, visible quality, gifted to them by more ancient or senior deities, whether in the form of a weapon, a crown, a cloak, or a bodily aura. But by the end of the second millennium BCE, the dazzling, blazing radiance of the gods&rsquo; bodies had come to be a defining characteristic of divinity &ndash; much as skin tone has become one of the dominant markers of identity in the modern world. When the mighty Babylonian god Marduk was born, for example, he already &lsquo;wore on his body the auras of ten gods&rsquo; and &lsquo;five fearsome rays clustered above him&rsquo;, explaining why he was known to his worshippers as the &lsquo;Bright One&rsquo;, &lsquo;the shining god who illuminates our ways&rsquo;.9 In temples, the radiant splendour of the gods was manifest in the polished gold, silver and bronze &lsquo;skin&rsquo; of their cult statues. The manufactured nature of these precious metals did not render them any less godly. They were long believed to have their origins in the heavenly plane. Imbued with a divine radiance imparted by the gods themselves, they had been worked into the fabric of the earthly realm as it was divinely crafted, waiting to be revealed to mortals as and when the gods saw fit.10 This is precisely the way in which the gods&rsquo; royal servants and priestly attendants perceived the materials used to construct the cult images in their temples. Well into the first millennium BCE, kings were still boasting of the divine nature of the metals and stones used to create images of the gods. When King Esarhaddon of Assyria (c. 681&ndash;669 BCE) speaks of the &lsquo;destiny of radiance&rsquo; gifted by the ancient high god Ea to cult statues, he emphasizes the primeval nature of their raw materials, hewn deep from the innards of creation &ndash; the &lsquo;quality gold, which no one had worked for any artistic task&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;select stones, not overgrown by vegetation&rsquo; mined from distant mountains.11 The dazzling nimbus of the divine body was not only an awesome, corporeal glamour, but the material manifestation of the deity&rsquo;s frightening, forceful charisma. This was often weaponized as the hot, dangerous light with which deities equipped themselves &ndash; thus both the underworld warrior deity Nergal and the warring goddess Ishtar are described as wearing a fiery melammu like an armoured cloak or tunic. In Ishtar&rsquo;s case, its power is such that it can boil the ocean: &lsquo;My melammu cooks the fish in the sea&rsquo;, she brags.12 On land, the divine radiance emanating from a god&rsquo;s body overwhelmed everything within its reach. According to King Ashurbanipal of Assyria (c. 668&ndash;627 BCE), &lsquo;the melammu of Ashur and Ishtar overwhelmed [the people of] the land of Elam, and they submitted to my yoke&rsquo;.13 The terrifying quality of divine radiance might also be embodied by the gods&rsquo; own monstrous sidekicks. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, the eponymous hero has to take on the so-called Scorpion-men &ndash; fabulously body-queer attendants of the Mesopotamian gods, who not only have the legs of a bird, a snake-headed penis and a scorpion&rsquo;s tail, but &lsquo;whose aura is frightful&rsquo;, and whose &lsquo;terrifying mantles of radiance drape the mountains&rsquo; they are tasked to protect.14 It is this awesome combination of luminescence, scorching splendour, metallic glare, dangerous fire and a weighty, weaponized force that characterizes the divine radiance of the God of the Bible. He too is &lsquo;wrapped in light as with a garment&rsquo; and &lsquo;clothed with glory and splendour&rsquo; &ndash; exalted language that, in English translations, is all too easily mistaken for the magisterial hyperbole of theological metaphor, but in its biblical (Hebrew) context, is the technical terminology used of the palpable, gleaming radiance emanating from God&rsquo;s body.15 In the book of Habakkuk, the dangerous glare of God&rsquo;s material form is powerfully illustrated in a poem celebrating his role as a warrior. Here, the deity emanates a dazzling splendour from the relative safety of a far-off sacred mountain called Paran, in a southern wilderness known as Teman. But as he marches into the human world, his weapons of light and gleaming brightness come into view, eclipsing even the sun and moon: His splendour covers the heavens, and the earth is full of his radiance . . . He has rays [coming out] from his hand . . . The mountains see you and quake, waters gush torrents; the Deep roars aloud, raising its hand aloft; Sun and Moon stand still, at the light of your arrows speeding by, by the gleaming splendour of your flashing spear; you stride the earth in fury, crushing nations in rage.16 God&rsquo;s radiance is clearly a double-edged sword for the inhabitants of the earthly realm, which is perhaps why his worshippers are repeatedly warned about the dangers of their god&rsquo;s radiant body. In the book of Isaiah, those who treasure the silver splendour and golden glory of &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; cult statues are cautioned either to walk &lsquo;in Yahweh&rsquo;s light&rsquo; or to take cover from the terrifying, vengeful menace of God&rsquo;s radiance: &lsquo;Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust, from the terror of Yahweh, and from the splendour of his majesty!&rsquo;17 No wonder God instructs Moses to take the same precaution when he asks to see the divine body atop the Holy Mountain in the wilderness. For over two thousand years, Jewish and Christian commentators have twisted Moses&rsquo; rear-view sighting of God into an elaborate allegory, claiming that it speaks to the ultimate unknowability and inscrutability of the divine. Not even the blessed Moses can take in the fullness of God. A notable exception was Joseph ben Isaac (more commonly titled Bekhor Shor), a twelfth-century CE French rabbi and scholar, who was far more comfortable than some of his learned colleagues with embracing the mysterious corporeality deeply embedded within the Torah&rsquo;s vision of God. What Moses experienced on Mount Sinai, he argued, was akin to what a more ordinary mortal can bear of the sun: its overwhelming splendour prevents us from looking directly at it, but we can gasp in wonder at its afterglow.18 In Exodus, however, God&rsquo;s luminescent backside clearly gives off something more powerful than a wondrous afterglow. When Moses finally descends from the Holy Mountain, clutching the Ten Commandments, his own face is startlingly transformed. But quite how is a matter of some debate, for the ancient Semitic root of the Hebrew term used to describe this transformation probably means &lsquo;horn&rsquo;, but is also associated with light. The earliest translations of this peculiar story indicate that, from at least the third century BCE, Moses was understood to have developed horn-like rays of light, so that his face beamed with a divine radiance. Other ancient scholars would assume Moses&rsquo; face literally grew horns &ndash; a symbol of the divine elsewhere in the Bible &ndash; giving rise to startling medieval images of Moses as a double-horned being. Either way, Moses undergoes a bodily transformation so profound that the Israelites cannot look him in the face and are afraid to go near him.19 Moses&rsquo; visual encounter with God has left its mark on him, rendering him more divine than human. As the first millennium BCE neared its close, the dazzling brightness of the biblical God had become a standard marker of divinity in earliest Judaism: Ezekiel&rsquo;s glowing god of sixth-century BCE Jerusalem had been recast in the second-century BCE book of Daniel as an ancient deity seated on a flaming throne, with clothing &lsquo;as white as snow&rsquo;; his divine emissary was said to have a face as bright as lightning, and a body gleaming like burnished bronze. It was a vision of God celebrated in 1 Enoch &ndash; another influential text of the period &ndash; in which &lsquo;streams of flaming fire&rsquo; shoot from beneath the divine throne. &lsquo;It was difficult to look at&rsquo;, Enoch confesses. But he cannot look away. He sees God, &lsquo;the Great Glory&rsquo;, seated upon the throne. &lsquo;His gown shone more brightly than the sun and was whiter than any snow&rsquo;; the deity is surrounded by flaming fire of such &lsquo;magnificence and glory&rsquo; that not even the multitude of angels standing in attendance dare look upon him.20 Many of the famous scrolls discovered near Qumran, by the Dead Sea, attest to a first-century BCE Jewish sect who counted themselves as &lsquo;the children of righteousness&rsquo; walking &lsquo;in the light&rsquo; of an archangel called the &lsquo;Prince of Light&rsquo;; their enemies were the &lsquo;children of injustice&rsquo; who were ruled by the &lsquo;Angel of Darkness&rsquo;. In their visions of the heavenly realm, God is surrounded by a celestial entourage of angels, whose bodies are enveloped in light.21 By the first century CE, Jewish texts commonly portray the divine messengers of God as luminous beings. Dressed in the bright white hues of the stars, shining angels crowd the godly realm. They bring brilliant light into the mundane world of mortals, flash into the prophetic dreams of the living and give illuminating tours of the heavens to the favoured few. The early followers of Jesus naturally shared these deep-rooted ideas about the iridescent nature of divine bodies. In the New Testament, the angel who announces Christ&rsquo;s birth to startled shepherds does so in a blaze of shining glory. It is an angel whose &lsquo;appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow&rsquo; who rolls back the stone of Jesus&rsquo; tomb, terrifying the Roman sentries who are supposed to be guarding his corpse.22 In Luke, two supernatural beings &lsquo;in dazzling clothes&rsquo; are found standing inside the empty tomb, while, in the Gospel of John, angels dressed &lsquo;in white&rsquo; are discovered sitting in the darkness of the newly abandoned grave.23 In the book of Revelation, the heavenly Christ has a head &lsquo;white as white wool, white as snow&rsquo;. His eyes blaze with fire, his feet gleam like burnished bronze and his face is &lsquo;like the sun shining with full force&rsquo;.24 So well known was the brightness of divine bodies that Paul felt the need to warn his Corinthian correspondents that even Satan himself might appear disguised &lsquo;as an angel of light&rsquo;.25 But even the pre-resurrection, earthly Jesus of Nazareth can give off the unmistakable aura of divine radiance. Unabashedly echoing the story of Moses&rsquo; encounter with the divine body on Sinai, an early tradition used in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke describes the divine transfiguration &ndash; or metamorphosis &ndash; of Jesus at the summit of a high mountain. &lsquo;His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white&rsquo;, notes the author of Matthew; &lsquo;his clothes became dazzling white such that no one on earth could bleach them&rsquo;, the writer of Mark helpfully explains. In Luke&rsquo;s Gospel, this divine transformation is pointedly described as Jesus&rsquo; radiant &lsquo;glory&rsquo;, using the Greek term doxa that ancient Jewish scribes had used to translate the Hebrew term for Yahweh&rsquo;s own bright &lsquo;glory&rsquo;, kabod. 26 By the end of the second century CE, this tradition would be further elaborated in a text known as the Acts of John, in which the transfiguration is an opportunity for the earthly Jesus to reveal his gigantic, divine body: &lsquo;his feet were whiter than snow, so that the ground there was lit up by his feet, and his head reached to heaven&rsquo;.27 By contrast, the writer of John&rsquo;s Gospel had felt no need for a glorious transfiguration. In this text, Jesus is already fully divine &ndash; a god made flesh, whose radiant &lsquo;glory&rsquo; (doxa) is an innate and pre-existent characteristic of his fully fledged divinity. &lsquo;I am the light of the world&rsquo;, Jesus declares.28 This was no theological abstraction. It was to claim a divine nature, casting Christ as the bodily manifestation of the divine light of creation, constructed in opposition to the darkness of primordial disorder, as was carefully spelled out in the prologue to the Gospel: All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it . . . The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.29 Christ&rsquo;s brightness was more than symbolic. Early believers imagined his extraordinary heavenly body to be a magnification of the form their own bodies would imminently take in the Kingdom of God. In his writings, Paul had frequently described this transformation using the language of getting dressed (in Greek, enduo), as he does in a letter to Christians in Corinth: &lsquo;For this perishable body puts on imperishability, and this mortal body puts on immortality&rsquo;.30 Throughout the book of Revelation, this wardrobe change is vividly portrayed: in the heavens, those believers who had been martyred on earth or conducted themselves virtuously are given gleaming white robes to wear, so that they too are clothed in the star-bright garments of immortality worn by heaven&rsquo;s divine inhabitants &ndash; including the whiterobed, radiant Christ himself.31 Heavenly radiance was so fundamental to ancient Christian constructs of divinity that it would come to play a defining role in the formulation of doctrine. In 325 CE, the Roman emperor Constantine convened a council of bishops at Nicaea, on the eastern shores of Lake Ascanius in modern-day Turkey. As a new worshipper of Christ (rather than a &lsquo;convert&rsquo; who had wholly abandoned his former gods), Constantine was keen to calm the increasingly vicious disputes among Christian theologians across his empire. At Nicaea, the objective was to settle, once and for all, arguments about the &lsquo;true&rsquo; nature of Christ&rsquo;s relationship, as divine Son, to God the Father. In particular, the council&rsquo;s attention was firmly focused on the longrunning feud between Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria, and Arius, his most learned presbyter. Both agreed that God the Father and God the Son were one. But they disagreed on the essential nature or &lsquo;substance&rsquo; (in Greek, ousia) of that oneness. The bishop held that God the Son was divine in exactly the same way as God the Father, and that the Son was eternally coexistent with the Father. Arius, on the other hand, argued that the Son could not be co-eternal with the Father, because scripture insisted he was &lsquo;begotten&rsquo; and &lsquo;made&rsquo; by the Father. The Father alone was self-existent and unbegotten. By contrast, the Son was neither self-existent nor unbegotten, for he had a beginning: &lsquo;There was before he was not&rsquo;, ran the Arian slogan. The Father&rsquo;s divinity was therefore greater than the Son&rsquo;s. The council sided with Bishop Alexander, and Arius was declared a heretic &ndash; a label derived from the language of &lsquo;choice&rsquo; or &lsquo;opinion&rsquo; (in Greek, hairesis), but increasingly employed to mean &lsquo;sect&rsquo;, and now used as a pejorative term to marginalize those Christians whose views risked undermining either the humanity or divinity of Jesus. But Arian views were shared by numerous Christian communities, particularly across the eastern empire. And so, in the fashion of most councils, an official policy was drawn up, circulated for comments, redrafted and finally agreed. As signatories to the document, those bishops who had been present at the meeting were expected to hold their congregations accountable to this new policy. Known as the &lsquo;Symbol of Nicaea&rsquo;, it was not only a declaration of faith, but a new definition of faith, and would form the basis of what is known as the Nicene Creed. &lsquo;We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible&rsquo;, the creed began. Then came the doctrinal dismissal of Arian teachings: And [we believe] in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten from the Father, only begotten, that is, from the substance of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, True God from True God, begotten, not made, from one substance with the Father . . . as for those who say There was when He was not, and Before being born He was not . . . these things the Catholic [whole] Church anathemizes.32 It is telling that the palpable divinity of the Father and Son was couched in the language of divine radiance: the Son is from the Father, as &lsquo;God from God, Light from Light&rsquo;. It was a claim increasingly mirrored in early Christian art across the empire. The bodily luminescence that once framed the ancient gods of pre-Christian south-west Asia began to appear around Christ as a full-body halo. One of the oldest examples occurs in a mosaic in the Catacomb of Saint Domitilla in Rome. Dated to the time of Pope Damasus (366&ndash;84 CE), it presents Christ seated on a throne between Peter and Paul, with a basket of scrolls at his feet, displaying the classic posture of a philosopher or teacher. A huge aura of brilliant lapis light encircles his whole body, its outer edge curling around the top of Peter&rsquo;s head as a divine seal of approval. An accompanying Latin inscription reads, &lsquo;You are said to be the Son and are found to be the Father&rsquo;, echoing the Nicene claim that the Son and the Father are of the same divine substance. A few decades later, in the Church of Hosios David, overlooking the Greek city of Thessaloniki, the divine radiance of the Father was emphatically claimed as Christ&rsquo;s own in another mosaic. Here, the prophet Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision of God&rsquo;s blazing glory is theologically recast, reflecting its recycling in the book of Revelation: robed in deep purples and rich reds, with golden sandals on his feet, a youthful Christ sits delicately on the rainbow that was once God&rsquo;s phallic war bow. He is surrounded by a vast gleaming aureole of bright light. From its outer edges emerge the animalized cherubim of the divine chariot throne. Christ holds an unrolled scroll, the first words of which read, &lsquo;Behold our God&rsquo; (Plate 12). The Son of God is clearly to be seen as the perfect likeness of his Father.33 The Christian iconography of light is more usually tracked back to the solar symbolism of Greek and Roman sun deities, whose shining halos were quickly grafted onto images of Christ, the Virgin and the apostles.34 But it is also the much older ancient south-west Asian notion of the divine radiance emanating from the torsos of the gods to encompass their bodies that shapes Christ&rsquo;s dazzling aureole in early Christian art. It was inevitable that the overwhelming melammu of Mesopotamian gods and the glorious kabod of Yahweh would eventually find their way onto the body of the new Christian god. The metallic gleam of cult statues was mirrored in the use of gold and silver to clad statues and icons of Christ and his heavenly family &ndash; a feature later intensified in the highly ornate art of the Byzantine Church, and still common to Eastern and Oriental Orthodox iconographies today. Whether shimmering in the glow of lamps in churches, or flashing bright in the light of outdoor processions, the radiance of these cult images, surrounded by the smoky swirls of incense and oil lamps, rendered them animated, so that they appeared to be brilliantly, phenomenally living.35 From Brightness to Whiteness If the glorious radiance of divine bodies enthralled worshippers, it also left a more sinister and deeply damaging legacy. The early Christian theology of light spoke to an increasingly dualistic religious worldview, in which the bright powers of God were contrasted with the dangerous, devilish forces of darkness, which themselves embodied a much older, seemingly primeval fear of what might lurk in the cover of night. &lsquo;God is light and in him there is no darkness at all&rsquo;, claims the writer of the Gospel of John. As Jesus is the embodiment of divine light in this Gospel, so his opponents are cast as evil-doers who &lsquo;love darkness rather than light&rsquo;. It is a theme running through John&rsquo;s story of Jesus, and impossible to miss: as soon as Satan enters Judas, he goes out into the darkness of the night to betray Jesus, who is arrested in the black of night by a detachment of Roman soldiers and temple guards.36 In the book of Acts, Paul&rsquo;s shift from a traditional form of Judaism to faith in Jesus Christ is said to have been triggered by his literal illumination by a light brighter than the sun shining down on him from heaven; Christ then commissions him to convert Jews and Gentiles &lsquo;so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me&rsquo;.37 To be debt-free of sin and sanctified by faith in Christ is to be in light. To be non-Christian and sullied by Satan is to be in darkness. The theological coding of evil and sin as &lsquo;darkness&rsquo; in early Christian writings drew heavily on the imagery of light and dark already embedded in some contemporaneous Jewish cosmologies, which themselves shared something in common with Persian Zoroastrianism, in which a divine cast of spirits of light and darkness competed for control of the universe. But in the hands of some Christian writers, the deviancy of &lsquo;darkness&rsquo; would come to acquire a polemical association with those with black skin. It marked a departure from the cultural norms of both ancient Jewish and GraecoRoman religions, in which black skin might be variously identified with beauty, majesty and wealth, as well as foreignness, erotic exoticism, or xenophobic danger. While these identifications were at times set within a context of perceived ethnic or geographical difference, they were not primarily constructed in what might now be considered racialized opposition to lighter skin: across ancient south-west Asia and the eastern Mediterranean, different social groups often classified themselves and others in terms of affiliations of city, homeland, religious practice, or culture (among other markers of identity), but the notion and category of &lsquo;race&rsquo; &ndash; as we use the term today &ndash; was yet to be conjured.38 But as early Christian groups negotiated their own self-identity in a context of ongoing difference and dispute (both among themselves and with those around them), the symbolism of blackness was increasingly used to caricature the physical appearance of those cast as deviant, heretical, or sinful.39 A popular strategy among the early Church Fathers was to lift particular geographic labels from their scriptures and redeploy them as a means of colouring sinners in need of Christian salvation. This is exactly what the fourth-century Balkan-born theologian Jerome does when he disturbingly caricatures &lsquo;Ethiopians&rsquo; (biblical Kushites) as &lsquo;black and cloaked in the filth of sin&rsquo; to illustrate the tangible, transformative power of Christian baptism and repentance: &lsquo;At one time we were Ethiopians in our vices and sins. How so? Because our sins had blackened us. But afterwards we heard the words: &ldquo;Wash yourselves clean!&rdquo; And we said: &ldquo;Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow&rdquo;. We are Ethiopians, therefore, who have been transformed from blackness into whiteness.&rsquo;40 For some Christians, Satan himself had already come to acquire not only the darkness of night, but the blackness of vice. In the Epistle of Barnabas, a highly influential text of the late first or early second century CE, the Devil is called the Black One and held responsible for all the sins that destroy the soul. It is quite a list: idolatry, impertinence, glorification of power, hypocrisy, duplicity, adultery, murder, robbery, arrogance, transgression, deceit, malice, insolence, sorcery, magic, greed and &lsquo;the lack of the fear of God&rsquo;. Satan is also cast as the black opponent of Christ in the late secondcentury Acts of Peter, in which he is said to attack the souls of Christians with poisoned arrows and is declaimed the source of &lsquo;wickedness and the abyss of darkness&rsquo;.41 But Satan&rsquo;s blackness could take on even more dangerous forms. According to the fourth-century theologian Athanasius, the young Egyptian monk later known as Saint Antony the Great repeatedly contended with Satan&rsquo;s most devilish devices while he was trying to get on with the business of being a desert-dwelling ascetic. In one of his toughest battles, Antony dealt not with the more usual blows of a demonic beating, but with the Devil himself, manifested as a woman so desirable that Antony had to fill his mind with visions of a worm-filled fiery hell in order to resist her. Satan changed tack, opting for a more direct approach &ndash; about which it is now thoroughly repugnant to read. In Athanasius&rsquo; Life of Antony, we are told: &lsquo;[Satan] appeared, as was fitting, in a form that revealed his true nature: an ugly black boy prostrated himself at Antony&rsquo;s feet, weeping loudly.&rsquo; The boy confesses his real identity and &ndash; in a tone of stunned incredulity &ndash; protests that he is usually far more successful at tempting young people into fornication. Antony realizes he is not quite so afraid. &lsquo;[He] gave thanks to God and strengthened by greater confidence in the face of the enemy, he said, &ldquo;You are utterly despicable and contemptible, for both your blackness and your age are signs of weakness. You do not worry me any longer&rdquo; &rsquo;.42 As Antony starts to sing a psalm, the boy vanishes.* The Devil might well have left with the painful sound of singing in his ears, but modern-day readers of the Life of Antony are more likely to hear alarm bells. The demonization of black people, dressed in tropes of eroticized danger and sinful deviancy, clearly continues to stalk the world in highly damaging and deadly forms today. Something of this can be attributed to the colour-coded dualism inherent within early Christian theology, which lent itself as easily to the whitening of divinity as it did to the blackening of evil. In the iconography of Western Christendom in particular, divine brightness and lightness would morph into corporeal whiteness. Encouraged by the repeated references to the white robes of the heavenly Christ and his angels in New Testament texts, which visually marked divine bodies as bleach bright, the golden hues of Christ&rsquo;s divinity were increasingly concentrated in his halo, while his skin grew ever lighter and whiter. Across early medieval Europe, on the walls of churches, in illustrated Bibles and prayer books, and in the pictures conjured in sermons, Jesus was made in the image of his light-skinned, wealthier worshippers &ndash; and increasingly contrasted with black demons. Pitch-black and pitchforked, they scuttled across religious landscapes, loomed from shadows behind unsuspecting God-fearers, and screamed with rage as Christ yanked them from the gasping mouths of the possessed. The racialized image of Christ as a light-skinned European would not only become a convention of the Western artistic canon, but a tool of political power, social oppression and state-sanctioned killing. As Europeans invaded other people&rsquo;s homelands in Africa, Asia and the Americas, and began the violent colonial process of brutalizing, exploiting and profiteering from two thirds of the world, the white-skinned European Christ lent his support to the conquest, oppression, enslavement and trafficking of those cast as black-, brown-, dark- or red-skinned &ndash; regardless of whether these people were already deemed appropriately God-fearing or not. By the late fifteenth century, the biblical story of Noah&rsquo;s son Ham had been twisted into an anti-black myth of African origins. The story is told in Genesis 9.18&ndash;27, in which Ham sees his father&rsquo;s nakedness, prompting Noah to inflict a curse of perpetual slavery upon Ham&rsquo;s descendants, the Canaanites. Nowhere in this peculiar tale are black colour terms used, and neither here nor anywhere else in the Hebrew Bible are Ham or the Canaanites pointedly associated with dark skin. Instead, in the next chapter in Genesis, Ham is simply said to be the ancestor of many other peoples in the repopulated, post-Flood world, including the Egyptians and the Kushites.43 But from the fourth century CE onwards, scholars would read a false etymology into the name of Ham, incorrectly linking it to words meaning &lsquo;dark&rsquo;, &lsquo;brown&rsquo; and &lsquo;black&rsquo;, so that in several Christian, Jewish and Islamic traditions, Ham was increasingly assumed to be the ancestor of all dark-skinned people. By the late fifteenth century, the biblical &lsquo;curse of Ham&rsquo; had become a scriptural proof-text in Western Christendom endorsing the perception of black-skinned people as a divinely ordained caste of slaves innately inferior to lighter-skinned Europeans.44 This distorted story has been a stock chapter in the white supremacist&rsquo;s playbook ever since. As European empires continued to build on the backs of those they first invaded and then oppressed and exploited, light skin tones were increasingly seen as the inherited physical hallmark of a cosmic supremacy. But it was a position which came with an earthly duty: white colonialism was frequently promoted as a godly and &lsquo;civilizing&rsquo; mission, commanded by Christ to extend salvation to non-white, non-Christians. The Saviour, cast in the New Testament as the paradigmatic form of humanity, made in the image of God, had been whitewashed. Christian salvation would remain a theological justification for the ongoing expansion or retention of both Roman Catholic and Protestant European empires well into the twentieth century. An oft-cited sub-Saharan African dictum illustrates this well: &lsquo;When the white man came to our country, he had the Bible and we had the land. The white man said to us, &ldquo;Let us pray.&rdquo; After the prayer, the white man had the land and we had the Bible.&rsquo;* For generations, people of colour led the way in countering the colonial hijacking of the Bible, demonstrating how it can offer an alternative, liberationist response to imperial oppression and white supremacy, pointing particularly to its emphasis on God&rsquo;s rescue of the Israelites enslaved in Egypt, and the victory of Christ over his death on an imperial cross.45 But by the time European colonizers had seized vast swathes of Australasia from its indigenous inhabitants, the cultural myth of divine whiteness had already birthed another Western falsehood: the pseudoscientific, physiological classification of people into &lsquo;races&rsquo;, complete with cranial and facial diagrams. These diagrams typically racialized and arranged people into an invented, stratified schema. The civilized &lsquo;Caucasian&rsquo; man, equipped with the heavenly curls of a marble-carved Greek god, the straight-cut nose of a Roman emperor and the lily-white skin of the colonial Christ, was placed at the apex of this imagined evolutionary hierarchy. Beneath him were positioned gross caricatures of East Asian people, SouthEast Asian people, indigenous peoples of the Americas and Australasia, and Jewish people, who had been physiologically othered in the West since at least 1000 CE. A black-skinned African man, depicted as an animalized &lsquo;primitive&rsquo;, was at its base.46 Some might say the rest is history. Except it&rsquo;s not, as the global Black Lives Matter movement is so clearly and repeatedly prompted to demonstrate in the face of ongoing racial killings and systemic injustices. It is impossible to overstate the continuing social and political ramifications of the theologically endorsed cultural othering of people of colour. A direct line can be drawn from the early Christian demonization of black people to the well-known repugnant episodes and echoes of European colonialism, some of which have formally come to an end, while some persist in different forms: the transatlantic slave trade, human zoos, death camps, state-sponsored eugenics, law-enforced segregation, the forced enclosure of indigenous peoples across the Americas and Australasia, South African apartheid, the false &lsquo;science&rsquo; of racialized evolution, to name but a frightful few. But whiteness remains the dominant, collective category of privilege, entitlement and power in much of the world, and continues to uphold the economic disparity, structural inequality and social injustices harming people of colour. And deep within its cultural heart is a racialized theology of light &ndash; a theology that has helped to create and sustain a reality in which people of colour continue to be marginalized, vilified and killed.</span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.u0a3nq7g6gin"><span class="c4">THE END</span></h1></body></html>
